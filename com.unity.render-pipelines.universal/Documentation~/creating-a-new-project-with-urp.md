# Using the Universal Render Pipeline in a new Project

If you want to use the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) in a new Project, you can create a new Project using a [Template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectTemplates.html).

To create a URP Project using a Template:

1. Open the Unity Hub.
2. On the Home page, click __New__ to start a new Project. The Templates popup appears.
3. Select the Universal Render Pipeline Template.
4. Click __Create__. Unity creates a new Project for you. The new Project has URP installed and configured, and includes some example content that demonstrates URP's functionality.
5. In the Project window, navigate to the _Assets_ folder, and select the __Readme__ Asset. Unity will show information about the Project in the Inspector window.
