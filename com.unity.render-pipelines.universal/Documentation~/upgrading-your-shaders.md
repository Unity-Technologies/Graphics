# Upgrading your Shaders

If your Project uses shaders from the built-in render pipeline, and you want to [switch your Project to use the Universal Render Pipeline instead](InstallURPIntoAProject.md), you must convert those Shaders to the URP Shaders. This is because built-in Lit shaders are not compatible with URP Shaders. For an overview of the mapping between built-in shaders and URP Shaders, see [Shader mappings](#shader-mappings).

To upgrade built-in Shaders:

1. Open your Project in Unity, and go to __Edit__ > __Render Pipeline__ > **Universal Render Pipeline**. 
2. According to your needs, select either __Upgrade Project Materials to URP Materials__ or __Upgrade Selected Materials to URP Materials__.

**Note:** These changes cannot be undone. Backup your Project before you upgrade it.

**Tip:** If the Preview thumbnails in Project View are incorrect after you've upgraded, try right-clicking anywhere in the Project View window and selecting __Reimport All__.

For [SpeedTree](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpeedTree.html) Shaders, Unity does not re-generate Materials when you re-import them, unless you click the **Generate Materials** or **Apply & Generate Materials** button.

## Shader mappings

The table below shows which URP shaders the Unity built-in shaders convert to when you run the shader upgrader.
