# Forward+ Rendering Path

The Forward+ Rendering Path lets you avoid the per object limit of the Forward Rendering Path.

The Forward+ Rendering Path has the following advantages compared with the Forward Rendering Path:

* There is no per-object limit for the number of Lights that affect GameObjects, the per-Camera limit still applies.<br/>The per-Camera limits for different platforms are:<ul><li>Desktop and console platforms: 256 Lights</li><li>Mobile platforms: 32 Lights. OpenGL ES 3.0 and earlier: 16 Lights.</li></ul>This let's you avoid splitting big meshes when more than 8 lights affect them.

* Blending of more than 2 reflection probes.

* Support for multiple Lights when using Unity Entity Component System (ECS).

* More flexibility with procedural draws.

## <a name="how-to-enable"></a>How to select the Forward+ Rendering Path

To select the Forward+ Rendering Path, use the property **Rendering** > **Rendering Path** in the URP Universal Renderer asset.

![Select the Rendering Path in the URP Universal Renderer asset](../Images/rendering/forward-plus/urp-select-forward-plus-path.png)

When you set the Rendering Path to Forward+, Unity ignores the values in the following properties in URP Asset, **Lighting** section:
* **Main Light**. With Forward+ the value of this property is **Per Pixel** regardless of the value you select.

* **Additional Lights**. With Forward+ the value of this property is **Per Pixel** regardless of the value you select.

* **Additional Lights** > **Per Object Limit**. Unity ignores this property.

* **Reflection Probes** > **Probe Blending**. Reflection probe blending is always on.

## Limitations

The Forward+ Rendering Path has the following limitations:

* Does not support the orthographic Camera projection.

* Does not support XR platforms.
