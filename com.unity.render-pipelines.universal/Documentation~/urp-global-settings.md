# URP Global Settings

If a project has the URP package installed, Unity shows the URP Global Settings section in the Graphics tab in the Project Settings window.

The URP Global Settings section lets you define project-wide settings for URP.

## Miscellaneous

| **Property**              | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Runtime Debug Shaders     | When disabled, all debug display shader variants are removed when you build for the Unity Player. This decreases build time, but prevents the use of Rendering Debugger in Player builds. |
