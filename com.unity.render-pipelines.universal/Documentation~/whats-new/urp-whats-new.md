This section contains information about new features, improvements, and issues fixed in URP 15.

For a complete list of changes made in URP 15, refer to the [Changelog](xref:changelog).

## Features

This section contains the overview of the new features in this release.

### Temporal anti-aliasing (TAA)

Temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) is a spatial multi-frame anti-aliasing technique that uses results from current and previous rendered frames to remove jaggies in the current frame and reduce temporal judder between frames.

TAA uses Motion Vectors to reduce or avoid shimmer and ghosting artifacts caused by moving objects that end up being in different pixel locations in different frames.

To enable TAA for a Camera:

* Select the Camera.

* In the Inspector, in the **Rendering** section, select **Temporal Anti-aliasing (TAA)** in the **Anti-aliasing** property.

The following image shows a frame with TAA off:

### High Dynamic Range (HDR) Output

[High Dynamic Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range) content has a wider color gamut and greater luminosity range than standard definition content.

URP can output HDR content for displays which support that functionality.

To activate HDR output, navigate to **Project Settings** > **Player** > **Other Settings** and enable **Use display in HDR mode**.

## Improvements

This section contains the overview of the major improvements in this release.

### FXAA quality improvements

This URP version improves the overall quality of FXAA. This implementation provides better edge anti-aliasing (removing odd edge artifacts seen with the previous implementation) and better retention of texture quality. The improvement does not affect performance. The output quality is now comparable to the low and medium SMAA presets but with better performance.

The following image shows the effect of the previous FXAA implementation (1) and the new one (2):

### Public API documentation improvements

In this release a significant amount of missing public API descriptions were added.

### New Soft Shadows Quality property

URP Asset now contains a **Quality** property under the **Soft Shadows** property, which lets you select the quality level of soft shadow processing. By default, all Lights use the quality setting from the URP Asset, and you can override that setting per Light using the **Soft Shadows Quality** property.

The **Quality** property in the URP Asset:
