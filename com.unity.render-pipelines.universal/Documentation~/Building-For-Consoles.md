# Building your Project for Closed platforms

If you have a license to develop games for Closed platforms that require you to meet the confidentiality and legal agreements of the platform provider, then see the relevant developer forums for a link to the console specific render pipeline package.

## Platform package installation

To install a platform package, download it from the relevant platform developer forum. Note that you cannot get these packages from the package registry or Package Manager. To do this:

1. Download the package for the platform that your Project targets. You can find each package on its respective platform developer forum. The download link is in the same location as the Unity installer for that platform.
2. Use the Package Manager to install the package locally. For information on how to install local packages, see [Installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).
