- Added Transparency Sort Mode and Transparency Sort Axis to 2DRendererData.
- Added support for a user defined default material to 2DRendererData.
- Added the option to toggle shadow receiving on transparent objects.
- Added XR multipass rendering. Multipass rendering is a requirement on many VR platforms and allows graceful fallback when single-pass rendering isn't available.
- Added support for Camera Stacking when using the Forward Renderer. This introduces the Camera `Render Type` property. A Base Camera can be initialized with either the Skybox or Solid Color, and can combine its output with that of one or more Overlay Cameras. An Overlay Camera is always initialized with the contents of the previous Camera that rendered in the Camera Stack.
- Added AssetPostprocessors and Shadergraphs to handle Arnold Standard Surface and 3DsMax Physical material import from FBX.
- Added `[MainTexture]` and `[MainColor]` shader property attributes to URP shader properties. These will link script material.mainTextureOffset and material.color to `_BaseMap` and `_BaseColor` shader properties.
- Added the option to specify the maximum number of visible lights. If you set a value, lights are sorted based on their distance from the Camera.
- Added the option to control the transparent layer separately in the Forward Renderer.
- Added the ability to set individual RendererFeatures to be active or not, use `ScriptableRendererFeature.SetActive(bool)` to set whether a Renderer Feature will execute,  `ScriptableRendererFeature.isActive` can be used to check the current active state of the Renderer Feature.
 additional steps to the 2D Renderer setup page for quality and platform settings.
- If Unity Editor Analytics are enabled, Universal collects anonymous data about usage of Universal. This helps the Universal team focus our efforts on the most common scenarios, and better understand the needs of our customers.
- Added a OnCameraSetup() function to the ScriptableRenderPass API, that gets called by the renderer before rendering each camera
- Added a OnCameraCleanup() function to the ScriptableRenderPass API, that gets called by the renderer after rendering each camera

- Added support for Normal Texture being generated in a prepass.
- Added a ConfigureInput() function to ScriptableRenderPass, so it is possible for passes to ask that a Depth, Normal and/or Opaque textures to be generated by the forward renderer.
- Added a float2 normalizedScreenSpaceUV to the InputData Struct.
- Added new sections to documentation: [Writing custom shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.0/manual/writing-custom-shaders-urp.html), and [Using the beginCameraRendering event](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.0/manual/using-begincamerarendering.html).
- Added support for GPU instanced mesh particles on supported platforms.

## [7.1.1] - 2019-09-05
### Upgrade Guide
- The render pipeline now handles custom renderers differently. You must now set up renderers for the Camera on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Render Pipeline Assets upgrades automatically and either creates a default forward renderer in your project or links the existing custom one that you've assigned.
- If you have custom renderers assigned to Cameras, you must now add them to the current Render Pipeline Asset. Then you can select which renderer to use on the Camera.

### Added
- Added shader function `GetMainLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for the main light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added shader function `GetAdditionalLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for an additional light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added a `Debug Level` option to the Render Pipeline Asset. With this, you can control the amount of debug information generated by the render pipeline.
- Added ability to set the `ScriptableRenderer` that the Camera renders with via C# using `UniversalAdditionalCameraData.SetRenderer(int index)`. This maps to the **Renderer List** on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added shadow support for the 2D Renderer. 
- Added ShadowCaster2D, and CompositeShadowCaster2D components.
- Added shadow intensity and shadow volume intensity properties to Light2D.
- Added new Gizmos for Lights.
- Added CinemachineUniversalPixelPerfect, a Cinemachine Virtual Camera Extension that solves some compatibility issues between Cinemachine and Pixel Perfect Camera.
- Added an option that disables the depth/stencil buffer for the 2D Renderer.
- Added manipulation handles for the inner cone angle for spot lights.
- Added documentation for the built-in post-processing solution and Volumes framework (and removed incorrect mention of the PPv2 package). 

### Changed
- Increased visible lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 256 visible lights except in mobile platforms. Mobile platforms support 32 visible lights.
- Increased per-object lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 8 per-object lights in all platforms except GLES2. GLES2 supports 4 per-object lights.
- The Sprite-Lit-Default shader and the Sprite Lit Shader Graph shaders now use the vertex tangents for tangent space calculations.
- Temporary render textures for cameras rendering to render textures now use the same format and multisampling configuration as camera's target texture.
- All platforms now use R11G11B10_UFloat format for HDR render textures if supported.
- There is now a list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset as opposed to a renderer type. These are available to all Cameras and are included in builds.
- The renderer override on the Camera is now an enum that maps to the list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Pixel Perfect Camera now allows rendering to a render texture.
- Light2D GameObjects that you've created now have a default position with z equal to 0.
- Documentation: Changed the "Getting Started" section into "Install and Configure". Re-arranged the Table of Content.

## [6.5.0] - 2019-03-07
### Added
- You can now create a custom forward renderer by clicking on `Assets/Create/Rendering/Lightweight Render Pipeline/Forward Renderer`. This creates an Asset in your Project. You can add additional features to it and drag-n-drop the renderer to either the pipeline Asset or to a camera.
- You can now add `ScriptableRendererFeature`  to the `ScriptableRenderer` to extend it with custom effects. A feature is an `ScriptableObject` that can be drag-n-dropped in the renderer and adds one or more `ScriptableRenderPass` to the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure lights. To do so, implement `SetupLights` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure culling. To do so, implement `SetupCullingParameters` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRendererData` contains rendering resources for `ScriptableRenderer`. A renderer can be overridden globally for all cameras or on a per-camera basis.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now has a `RenderPassEvents`. This controls where in the pipeline the render pass is added.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `ConfigureTarget` and `ConfigureClear`. This allows the renderer to automatically figure out the currently active rendering targets.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `Blit`. This performs a blit and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `RenderPostProcessing`. This renders post-processing and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `CreateDrawingSettings` as a helper for render passes that need to call `ScriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers`.

### Changed
- Removed `RegisterShaderPassName` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. Instead, `CreateDrawingSettings` now  takes one or a list of `ShaderTagId`. 
- Removed remaining experimental namespace from LWRP. All APIrelated to `ScriptableRenderer`, `ScriptableRenderPass`, and render pass injection is now out of preview.
- Removed `SetRenderTarget` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. You should never call it. Instead, call `ConfigureTarget`, and the renderer automatically sets up targets for you. 
- Removed `RenderFullscreenQuad` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `CommandBuffer.DrawMesh` and `RenderingUtils.fullscreenMesh` instead.
- Removed `RenderPostProcess` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `ScriptableRenderPass.RenderPostProcessing` instead.
- Removed `postProcessingContext` property from `ScriptableRenderer`. This is now exposed in `RenderingUtils.postProcessingContext`.
- Removed `GetCameraClearFlag` from `ScriptableRenderer`.

### Fixed

- New pass architecture. Allows for custom passes to be written and then used on a per camera basis in LWRP

### Changed
- Shadow rendering has been optimized for the Mali Utgard architecture by removing indexing and avoiding divisions for orthographic projections. This reduces the frame time by 25% on the Overdraw benchmark.
- Removed 7x7 tent filtering when using cascades.
- Screenspace shadow resolve is now only done when rendering shadow cascades.
- Updated the UI for the Lighweight pipeline asset.
- Update assembly definitions to output assemblies that match Unity naming convention (Unity.*).

## [2.0.0-preview] - 2018-01-01

### Added
- Explicit render target load/store actions were added to improve tile utilization
- Camera opaque color can be requested on the pipeline asset. It can be accessed in the shader by defining a _CameraOpaqueTexture. This can be used as an alternative to GrabPass.
- Dynamic Batching can be enabled in the pipeline asset
- Pipeline now strips unused or invalid variants and passes based on selected pipeline capabilities in the asset. This reduces build and memory consuption on target.
- Shader stripping settings were added to pipeline asset

### Changed
#### Pipeline
- Pipeline code is now more modular and extensible. A ForwardRenderer class is initialized by the pipeline with RenderingData and it's responsible for enqueueing and executing passes. In the future pluggable renderers will be supported.
- On mobile 1 directional light + up to 4 local lights (point or spot) are computed
- On other platforms 1 directional light + up to 8 local lights are computed
- Multiple shadow casting lights are supported. Currently only 1 directional + 4 spots light shadows.
#### Shading Framework
- Directional Lights are always considered a main light in shader. They have a fast shading path with no branching and no indexing.
- GetMainLight() is provided in shader to initialize Light struct with main light shading data. 
- Directional lights have a dedicated shadowmap for performance reasons. Shadow coord always comes from interpolator.
- MainLigthRealtimeShadowAttenuation(float4 shadowCoord) is provided to compute main light realtime shadows.
- Spot and Point lights are always shaded in the light loop. Branching on uniform and indexing happens when shading them.
- GetLight(half index, float3 positionWS) is provided in shader to initialize Light struct for spot and point lights.
- Spot light shadows are baked into a single shadow atlas.
- Shadow coord for spot lights is always computed on fragment.
- Use LocalLightShadowAttenuation(int lightIndex, float3 positionWS) to comppute realtime shadows for spot lights.
