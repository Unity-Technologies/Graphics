## [8.0.1] - 2020-02-25

Version Updated
The version number for this package has increased due to a version update of a related graphics package.

## [8.0.0] - 2020-02-25
### Added
- Added the option to strip Terrain hole Shader variants.
- Added support for additional Directional Lights. The amount of additional Directional Lights is limited by the maximum Per-object Lights in the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added default implementations of OnPreprocessMaterialDescription for FBX, Obj, Sketchup and 3DS file formats.
- Added Transparency Sort Mode and Transparency Sort Axis to 2DRendererData.
- Added support for a user defined default material to 2DRendererData.
- Added the option to toggle shadow receiving on transparent objects.
- Added XR multipass rendering. Multipass rendering is a requirement on many VR platforms and allows graceful fallback when single-pass rendering isn't available.
- Added support for Camera Stacking when using the Forward Renderer. This introduces the Camera `Render Type` property. A Base Camera can be initialized with either the Skybox or Solid Color, and can combine its output with that of one or more Overlay Cameras. An Overlay Camera is always initialized with the contents of the previous Camera that rendered in the Camera Stack.
- Fixed NaNs in tonemap algorithms (neutral and ACES) on Nintendo Switch.
- Added AssetPostprocessors and Shadergraphs to handle Arnold Standard Surface and 3DsMax Physical material import from FBX.
- Added `[MainTexture]` and `[MainColor]` shader property attributes to URP shader properties. These will link script material.mainTextureOffset and material.color to `_BaseMap` and `_BaseColor` shader properties.
- Added the option to specify the maximum number of visible lights. If you set a value, lights are sorted based on their distance from the Camera.
- Added the option to control the transparent layer separately in the Forward Renderer.
- Added the ability to set individual RendererFeatures to be active or not, use `ScriptableRendererFeature.SetActive(bool)` to set whether a Renderer Feature will execute,  `ScriptableRendererFeature.isActive` can be used to check the current active state of the Renderer Feature.

### Changed
- Moved the icon that indicates the type of a Light 2D from the Inspector header to the Light Type field.
- Eliminated some GC allocations from the 2D Renderer.
- Added SceneSelection pass for TerrainLit shader.

- UniversalRenderPipelineAsset no longer supports presets [case 1197020](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-reset-functionality-does-not-work-on-preset-of-universalrenderpipelineassets)
- The number of maximum visible lights is now determined by whether the platform is mobile or not.
- Renderer Feature list is now redesigned to fit more closely to the Volume Profile UI, this vastly improves UX and reliability of the Renderer Features List.
- Default color values for Lit and SimpleLit shaders changed to white due to issues with texture based workflows.
- The pipeline is now computing tangent space in per fragment.
- Optimized the 2D Renderer to skip rendering into certain internal buffers when not necessary.
- You can now subclass ForwardRenderer to create a custom renderer based on it.
- URP shaders that contain a priority slider now no longer have an offset of 50 by default.

## [7.1.1] - 2019-09-05
### Upgrade Guide
- The render pipeline now handles custom renderers differently. You must now set up renderers for the Camera on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Render Pipeline Assets upgrades automatically and either creates a default forward renderer in your project or links the existing custom one that you've assigned.
- If you have custom renderers assigned to Cameras, you must now add them to the current Render Pipeline Asset. Then you can select which renderer to use on the Camera.

### Added
- Added shader function `GetMainLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for the main light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added shader function `GetAdditionalLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for an additional light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added a `Debug Level` option to the Render Pipeline Asset. With this, you can control the amount of debug information generated by the render pipeline.
- Added ability to set the `ScriptableRenderer` that the Camera renders with via C# using `UniversalAdditionalCameraData.SetRenderer(int index)`. This maps to the **Renderer List** on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added shadow support for the 2D Renderer. 
- Added ShadowCaster2D, and CompositeShadowCaster2D components.
- Added shadow intensity and shadow volume intensity properties to Light2D.
- Added new Gizmos for Lights.
- Added CinemachineUniversalPixelPerfect, a Cinemachine Virtual Camera Extension that solves some compatibility issues between Cinemachine and Pixel Perfect Camera.
- Added an option that disables the depth/stencil buffer for the 2D Renderer.
- Added manipulation handles for the inner cone angle for spot lights.
- Added documentation for the built-in post-processing solution and Volumes framework (and removed incorrect mention of the PPv2 package). 

### Changed
- Increased visible lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 256 visible lights except in mobile platforms. Mobile platforms support 32 visible lights.
- Increased per-object lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 8 per-object lights in all platforms except GLES2. GLES2 supports 4 per-object lights.
- The Sprite-Lit-Default shader and the Sprite Lit Shader Graph shaders now use the vertex tangents for tangent space calculations.
- Temporary render textures for cameras rendering to render textures now use the same format and multisampling configuration as camera's target texture.
- All platforms now use R11G11B10_UFloat format for HDR render textures if supported.
- There is now a list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset as opposed to a renderer type. These are available to all Cameras and are included in builds.
- The renderer override on the Camera is now an enum that maps to the list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Pixel Perfect Camera now allows rendering to a render texture.
- Light2D GameObjects that you've created now have a default position with z equal to 0.
- Documentation: Changed the "Getting Started" section into "Install and Configure". Re-arranged the Table of Content.
- Default attachment setup behaviour for ScriptableRenderPasses that execute before rendering opaques is now set use current the active render target setup. This improves performance in some situations.

## [6.5.0] - 2019-03-07
### Added
- You can now create a custom forward renderer by clicking on `Assets/Create/Rendering/Lightweight Render Pipeline/Forward Renderer`. This creates an Asset in your Project. You can add additional features to it and drag-n-drop the renderer to either the pipeline Asset or to a camera.
- You can now add `ScriptableRendererFeature`  to the `ScriptableRenderer` to extend it with custom effects. A feature is an `ScriptableObject` that can be drag-n-dropped in the renderer and adds one or more `ScriptableRenderPass` to the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure lights. To do so, implement `SetupLights` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderer` now exposes interface to configure culling. To do so, implement `SetupCullingParameters` when you create a new renderer.
- `ScriptableRendererData` contains rendering resources for `ScriptableRenderer`. A renderer can be overridden globally for all cameras or on a per-camera basis.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now has a `RenderPassEvents`. This controls where in the pipeline the render pass is added.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `ConfigureTarget` and `ConfigureClear`. This allows the renderer to automatically figure out the currently active rendering targets.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `Blit`. This performs a blit and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `RenderPostProcessing`. This renders post-processing and sets the active render target in the renderer.
- `ScriptableRenderPass` now exposes `CreateDrawingSettings` as a helper for render passes that need to call `ScriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers`.

### Changed
- Removed `RegisterShaderPassName` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. Instead, `CreateDrawingSettings` now  takes one or a list of `ShaderTagId`. 
- Removed remaining experimental namespace from LWRP. All APIrelated to `ScriptableRenderer`, `ScriptableRenderPass`, and render pass injection is now out of preview.
- Removed `SetRenderTarget` from `ScriptableRenderPass`. You should never call it. Instead, call `ConfigureTarget`, and the renderer automatically sets up targets for you. 
- Removed `RenderFullscreenQuad` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `CommandBuffer.DrawMesh` and `RenderingUtils.fullscreenMesh` instead.
- Removed `RenderPostProcess` from `ScriptableRenderer`. Use `ScriptableRenderPass.RenderPostProcessing` instead.
- Removed `postProcessingContext` property from `ScriptableRenderer`. This is now exposed in `RenderingUtils.postProcessingContext`.
- Removed `GetCameraClearFlag` from `ScriptableRenderer`.

### Fixed
- Fixed y-flip in VR when post-processing is active.
- Fixed occlusion mesh for VR not rendering before rendering opaques.
- Enabling or disabling SRP Batcher in runtime works now.
- Fixed video player recorder when post-processing is enabled.

## [6.2.0] - 2019-02-15

### Changed
- Code refactor: all macros with ARGS have been swapped with macros with PARAM. This is because the ARGS macros were incorrectly named.

## [6.1.0] - 2019-02-13

## [6.0.0] - 2019-02-23
### Added
- You can now implement a custom renderer for LWRP. To do so, implement an `IRendererData` that contains all resources used in rendering. Then create an `IRendererSetup` that creates and queues `ScriptableRenderPass`. Change the renderer type either in the Pipeline Asset or in the Camera Inspector.
- LWRP now uses the Unity recorder extension. You can use this to capture the output of Cameras.
- You can now inject a custom render pass before LWRP renders opaque objects. To do so, implement an `IBeforeRender` interface.
- Distortion support in all Particle Shaders.
- An upgrade system for LWRP Materials with `MaterialPostprocessor`.
- An upgrade path for Unlit shaders
- Tooltips for Shaders.
- SRP Batcher support for Particle Shaders.
- Docs for these Shaders: Baked Lit, Particles Lit, Particles Simple Lit, and Particles Unlit.
- LWRP now supports dynamic resolution scaling. The target platform must also support it.
- LWRP now includes version defines for both C# and Shaders in the format of `LWRP_X_Y_Z_OR_NEWER`. For example, `LWRP_5_3_0_OR_NEWER` defines version 5.3.0.
- The Terrain Lit Shader now samples Spherical Harmonics if you haven't baked any lightmaps for terrain.
- Added a __Priority__ option, which you can use to tweak the rendering order. This is similar to render queue in the built-in render pipeline. These Shaders now have this option: Lit, Simple Lit, Baked Lit, Unlit, and all three Particle Shaders.
- Added support for overriding terrain detail rendering shaders, via the render pipeline editor resources asset.

### Changed
- You can now only initialize a camera by setting a Background Type. The supported options are Skybox, Solid Color, and Don't Care.
- LWRP now uses non-square shadowmap textures when it renders directional shadows with 2 shadow cascades. 
- LWRP now uses RGB111110 as the HDR format on mobile devices, when this format is supported.
- Removed `IAfterDepthPrePass` interface.
- We’ve redesigned the Shader GUI. For example, all property names in Shaders are now inline across the board
- The Simple Lit Shader now has Smoothness, which can be stored in the alpha of specular or albedo maps.
- The Simple Lit and Particles Simple Lit Shaders now take shininess from the length (brightness) of the specular map.
- The __Double sided__ property is now __Render Face__. This means you can also do front face culling.
- Changed the docs for Lit Shader, Simple Lit Shader and Unlit Shader according to Shader GUI changes.
- When you create a new LWRP Asset, it will now be initialized with settings that favor performance on mobile platforms.
- Updated the [FAQ](faq.md) and the [Built-in/LWRP feature comparison table](lwrp-builtin-feature-comparison.md).

### Changed
#### Pipeline
- Pipeline code is now more modular and extensible. A ForwardRenderer class is initialized by the pipeline with RenderingData and it's responsible for enqueueing and executing passes. In the future pluggable renderers will be supported.
- On mobile 1 directional light + up to 4 local lights (point or spot) are computed
- On other platforms 1 directional light + up to 8 local lights are computed
- Multiple shadow casting lights are supported. Currently only 1 directional + 4 spots light shadows.
#### Shading Framework
- Directional Lights are always considered a main light in shader. They have a fast shading path with no branching and no indexing.
- GetMainLight() is provided in shader to initialize Light struct with main light shading data. 
- Directional lights have a dedicated shadowmap for performance reasons. Shadow coord always comes from interpolator.
- MainLigthRealtimeShadowAttenuation(float4 shadowCoord) is provided to compute main light realtime shadows.
- Spot and Point lights are always shaded in the light loop. Branching on uniform and indexing happens when shading them.
- GetLight(half index, float3 positionWS) is provided in shader to initialize Light struct for spot and point lights.
- Spot light shadows are baked into a single shadow atlas.
- Shadow coord for spot lights is always computed on fragment.
- Use LocalLightShadowAttenuation(int lightIndex, float3 positionWS) to comppute realtime shadows for spot lights.
