### Added
- `IGraphAssetModel.CanBeSubgraph`, a virtual method to Check the conditions to specify whether an Asset Graph can be a subgraph or not.
- `SubgraphPropertiesField`, a field that can be added to the Graph Inspector. It contains a checkbox to specify if the Asset graph should be shown in the Node library, the path to find it in the library and a description of the graph.
