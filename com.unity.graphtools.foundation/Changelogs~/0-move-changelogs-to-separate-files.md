### Added
- `CsoTool`, the base class for tools that use the command-state-observer system.
- `BaseGraphTool`, derived from `CsoTool`.
- `UnloadGraphAssetCommand`, used to unload a graph asset from the graph tool.
- `BaseView`: a base class for views.
- `IModelView.GraphTool`, the tool that owns the view.
- `Stencil.GetDebugInstrumentationHandler()`, to get the `DebugInstrumentationHandler`.
- `ICommandTarget`, an interface for classes that can receive a command.
- `IState.AddStateComponent()`, to add a state component to the state.
- `IState.RemoveStateComponent()`, to remove a state component from the state.
- `IStateComponentUpdater.Move(IStateComponent source)`, to move data from a state component to an other. The source state component will not be used after the move.
- `IUndoableStateComponent`, a state component that can be pushed on the undo stack.
- `UndoData`, used to hold serialized data for undoable operations.
- `Dispatcher.GetCommandHandler<>`, used to get the current command handler for a command type.
- Extension methods on `Dispatcher` to register command handlers that accept from 0 to 4 parameters, in addition to the command parameter.
- `ObserverManager`, the class now responsible for managing observer. Extracted from the `Dispatcher` class.
- `GraphModel.GenerateGraphVariableDeclarationUniqueName`, implemented to get a unique variable declaration name.

### Removed
- `GraphToolState`: use `State` instead. Add state components to the State.
  - `GraphToolState.BlackboardState` is now accessible from `Blackboard`.
  - `GraphToolState.GraphViewState` is now accessible from `GraphView`.
  - `GraphToolState.SelectionState` is now accessible from `GraphView`.
  - `GraphToolState.WindowState` is now accessible from `BaseGraphTool.ToolState`.
  - `GraphToolState.GraphProcessingState` is now accessible from `BaseGraphTool`.
  - `GraphToolState.TracingStatusState` is now accessible from `DebugInstrumentationHandler`.
  - `GraphToolState.TracingControlState` is now accessible from `DebugInstrumentationHandler`.
  - `GraphToolState.TracingDataState` is now accessible from `DebugInstrumentationHandler`.
  - `GraphToolState.ModelInspectorState` is now accessible from `ModelInspectorView`.
- `IDebugger.OnToggleTracing`: use an observer on `TracingStatusStateComponent` and watch its `TracingEnabled` property.
- `IModelView.CommandDispatcher`: use `BaseView.Dispatch()` to dispatch commands; use `BaseView.Dispatcher` for other purposes, like registering command handlers.
- `GraphViewEditorWindow.EditorToolName`: use `GraphViewEditorWindow.GraphTool.Name` instead.
- `IStencil.ToolName`: use `BaseGraphTool.Name` instead.
- `GraphViewEditorWindow.CommandDispatcher`: use `GraphViewEditorWindow.GraphTool.Dispatch` or `GraphViewEditorWindow.GraphTool.Dispatcher` instead. Be aware that some command handlers may be registered on a view (for example the `GraphView`) and you may need to dispatch your command to the view.
- `Stencil.OnDragAndDropVariableDeclarations()`: register your own command handler for `CreateVariableNodesCommand` instead of overriding.
- `IState.RegisterCommandHandlers()`: see the upgrade guide on how to register command handlers.
- `IStateComponent.StateSlotName`: implementation replaced by `StateComponent.ComponentName`.
- `IStateComponent.BeforeSerialize()`: not needed anymore.
- `IStateComponent.AfterDeserialize()`: not needed anymore.
- `StateComponent.ValidateAfterDeserialize()`: not needed anymore.

### Changed
- `WindowStateComponent` was renamed to `ToolStateComponent`.
- Command handlers now receive zero or more `StateComponent`s as parameters, instead of the `GraphToolState`.
- `CreateUI<>()` and UI factory methods do not take a `Dispatcher`/`CommandDispatcher` parameter anymore.
- `EdgeConnector` constructor now takes a `GraphView` as its first parameter.
- `EdgeDragHelper` constructor now takes a `GraphView` as its first parameter.
- `EdgeConnector.SetDropOutsideDelegate` delegate's first parameter is now a `GraphView`.
- `EdgeConnector.SetDropDelegate` delegate's first parameter is now a `GraphView`.
- `GraphView.RebuildUI()`: removed the `Dispatcher` parameter.
- Observers observed components and modified components are now specified using objects, not names.
- `ICustomPropertyField.Build()` now takes a `ICommandTarget` as first parameter.
- `IModelUI.Setup()` and `IModelUI.SetupBuildAndUpdate()` do not have a `Dispatcher` parameter anymore.
- `PortContainer.UpdatePorts()` does not have a `Dispatcher` parameter anymore.
- `GraphViewEditorWindow.CreateInitialState()` renamed to `GraphViewEditorWindow.InitState()`.
- `Stencil.CreateNodesFromPort()` parameters changed.
- `IStateObserver.ObservedStateComponents` changed from `IEnumerable<string>` to `IEnumerable<IStateComponent>`.
- `IStateObserver.ModifiedStateComponents` changed from `IEnumerable<string>` to `IEnumerable<IStateComponent>`.
- `IStateObserver.Observe()` does not need an `IState` anymore.
- `StateObserver` is not generic anymore.
- `StateComponent.StateSlotName` was replaced by `StateComponent.ComponentName`.
- `StateComponent` now implements `IUndoableStateComponent`.
- `CommandHandlerFunctorBase` and `CommandHandlerFunctor<>` were moved out of the `Dispatcher` class.
- All observer related API from `Dispatcher` was moved into the new `ObserverManager` class.
- `Dispatcher` is not an `IDisposable` anymore.
- `GraphNodeModelSearcherItem` constructor changed to match `SearcherItem` constructors, plus parameters.
- `GraphNodeModelSearcherItem` `CreateElements` changed to `CreateElement` as the multiple elements aspect was not used and ignored by internals.
- `GraphModel.InstantiateVariableDeclaration` generates a unique name for the new instantiated variable declaration.
