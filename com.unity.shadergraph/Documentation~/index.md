# About Shader Graph

## Description

Shader Graph enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of writing code, you create and connect nodes in a graph framework. Shader Graph gives instant feedback that reflects your changes, and itâ€™s simple enough for users who are new to shader creation.

For an introduction to Shader Graph, see [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md).

Shader Graph is available through the Package Manager window in supported versions of the Unity Editor. If you install a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) such as the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest) (URP) or the [High Definition Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest) (HDRP), Unity automatically installs Shader Graph in your project.

Shader Graph package versions on Unity Engine 2018.x are *Preview* versions, which do not receive bug fixes and feature maintenance. To work with an actively supported version of Shader Graph, use Unity Engine 2019.1 or higher.
