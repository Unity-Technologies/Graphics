# Length Node

## Description

Returns the length of input **In**. This is also known as magnitude. A vector's length is calculated with [Pythagorean Theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).

The length of a **Vector 2** can be calculated as:

Where *x* and *y* are the components of the input vector. Length can be calculated for other dimension vectors by adding or removing components.

And so on.
