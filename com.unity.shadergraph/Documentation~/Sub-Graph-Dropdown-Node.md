# Sub Graph Dropdown Node


## Description
This is a node which enables you to add a custom dropdown menu to Sub Graphs.

It is possible to set up and use a Sub Graph Dropdown node in the same way you use a [Keyword Node](Keyword-Node). The Graph Inspector exposes many of the same properties it does for an [enum keyword](Keywords). However, in this case you use those properties to specify the options that appear in your dropdown.

### Adding a Sub Graph dropdown

1. Add a Dropdown property to the Blackboard in your Sub Graph.
2. Add a Sub Graph Dropdown node to your Sub Graph. This node exposes the options you have specified.
3. Wire inputs to the options.
4. Use the Sub Graph in your graph.
