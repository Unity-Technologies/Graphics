### Graph Settings Menu

| Menu Item | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Precision | A [Precision Type](Precision-Types.md) drop-down menu that lets you set the precision for the entire graph. |
| Active Targets | A list that contains the Targets you've selected. Entries can be added or removed using the Add (+) and Remove (-) buttons. Shader Graph supports three targets: the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.0/manual/index.html), the [High Definition Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@12.0/manual/index.html), and the [Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html). |

Target-specific settings appear below the standard setting options. The displayed Target-specific settings change according to which Targets you select.
