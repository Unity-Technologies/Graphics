# Keyword node

## Description
You can use a Keyword node to create a static branch in your Shader Graph that references a [Keyword](Keywords.md) on the [Blackboard](Blackboard.md). The appearance of a Keyword node, including its available ports, changes based on the Keyword it references.

## Creating new Keyword Nodes
Because each Keyword node references a specific Keyword, you must first define at least one Keyword on the Blackboard. Drag a Keyword from the Blackboard to the workspace to make a Keyword node that corresponds to that Keyword.

You can also right-click anywhere on the workspace, and use the **Create Node** menu to make a new Keyword node. Under **Keywords**, there is a list of Keywords that you defined on the Blackboard. Click on a Keyword in that list to create a corresponding Keyword node.
