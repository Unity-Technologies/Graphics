# Getting started with Shader Graph

As of 2021.2, Shader Graph is compatible with Unity's built-in render pipeline, and the Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRPs): the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). These two SRPs are available in Unity 2018.1 and later.

Shader Graph is included with the HDRP and URP packages. When you add either SRP to your project, Unity automatically installs the Shader Graph package. If you are on Unity version 2021.2 and later, you can use Shader Graph with the built-in render pipeline by installing Shader Graph through the Package Manager. For more information on how to install a package, see [Adding and removing packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-actions.html) in the Unity User Manual.

For more information about setting up an SRP, see [Getting started with HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Getting-started-with-HDRP.html) or [Getting started with URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/InstallingAndConfiguringURP.html).
