# Blackboard

## Description
The Blackboard lists [Properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) and [Keywords](Keywords) you can use in this graph. It is also where you can edit the path for this Shader Graph Asset or Sub Graph.
You can move the Blackboard anywhere in the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window). It always maintains the same distance from the nearest corner, even if you resize the window.


## Creating nodes
Drag a Property or Keyword from the Blackboard to the graph to create a node of that kind. To create a new Property or Keyword, click the **Add (+)** button on the Blackboard's title bar and select a type. For a full list of Property types, see [Property Types](Property-Types).
