# Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes are objects in a graph view that you can write in. They are the graph view equivalent of a comment in code, and consist of a title and body. You can create as many as you want in the graph, and use them for a variety of purposes, for example:

- To describe how a section of your graph works.
- To leave notes for yourself or others collaborating in your Unity Project.
- As a to-do list that includes tasks to complete at a later date.

## Using Sticky Notes

To create a Sticky Note, right-click an empty space in the graph view and, in the context menu, click **Create Sticky note**. You can now customize and add content to the new Sticky Note. There are two text areas that you can write to:

- **Title**: The text area at the top of the Sticky Note is the title. Here you can concisely describe what the Sticky Note contains in its body text area. For example, this could be the name of the graph section the Sticky Note describes.
- **Body**: The larger text area below the title area is the body. You can write the full contents of the note here.

### Controls

This section describes how to edit text, move and resize the Sticky Note, and perform other actions.

#### Editing text

To edit text on a Sticky Note, double-click on a text area. This also selects all of the text in the area so be sure to move the text cursor before you edit the text.

#### Moving and resizing

You can move Sticky Notes anywhere on the graph. For information on how to do this, see [manipulating graph elements](VisualEffectGraphWindow.md#moving-elements).

You can also resize Sticky Notes. You can resize the Sticky Note manually or the Sticky Note can resize itself automatically to fit its contents. For information on how to make the Sticky Note resize itself, see the **Fit To Text** option in the [Context menu](#context-menu). For information on how to resize the Sticky Note manually, see [manipulating graph elements](VisualEffectGraphWindow.md#moving-elements).
