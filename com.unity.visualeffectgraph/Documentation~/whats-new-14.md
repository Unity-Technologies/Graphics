VFX Graph version 14 includes a new way to light smoke effects. You can now use custom lightmaps exported from third-party software to light your smoke texture. VFX Graph bakes six light directions from these lightmaps and uses them to light the smoke from every direction.

VFX Graph 14 improves the workflow of visual effects in Timeline. You can use the new VFX Animation clip to scrub through and control VFX Graph [Events](Events.md). You can also control how the effect reinitializes and pre-warm the effect. For more information, see [Timeline](Timeline.md).

### Skinned mesh sampling

In VFX Graph 14 improves aspects of the Skinned Mesh Renderer Sampling based on your feedback in the following ways:

- You can now retrieve the position velocity directly in the **Sample Skinned Mesh** Operator.
- You can orient particles in the transform, defined by the sampled tangent and normal.
- Root bone transform options are now integrated into the block or operator, which means you don’t need to use a property binder.
