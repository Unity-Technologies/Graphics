# Output Particle Point
Menu Path : **Context > Output Particle Point**

The **Output Particle Point** Context uses points to render a particle system. It always draws points as single pixels regardless of the distance of the particle to the camera or each particle's size and scale attributes.

This output does not support texturing or [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest).

For information about the generic output settings this Context shares with all other Contexts, see [Global Output Settings and Properties](Context-OutputSharedSettings.md).
