# Vector

A world-space or local-space three-component vector. When the Visual Effect Graph transforms a Vector, it does not take translation into account, only rotation and scale. This is different from a [Position](Type-Position.md) because when the Visual Effect Graph transforms a Position, it also takes translation into account, as well as rotation and scale.
