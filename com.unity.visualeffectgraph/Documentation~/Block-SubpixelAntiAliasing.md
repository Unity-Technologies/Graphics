# Subpixel Anti-Aliasing

Menu Path : **Output > Subpixel Anti-Aliasing**

The **Subpixel Anti-Aliasing** Block forces the ScaleX and ScaleY to cover at least one pixel of the screen. If this Block enlarges a particle to make it fit at least one pixel, it reduces the alpha of the particle to compensate for the particle contribution.
