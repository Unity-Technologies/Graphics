You can use inline Operators to:
* Store constant values (which you can also convert to [Properties](../Properties.md)).
* Be the destination for a combination of values from different inputs. In this case, the Operator acts as a "builder" which takes individual values and outputs a coherent object.
* Cast between compatible types.
* Perform redirections in large graphs (redirect only one long connection instead of multiple ones).
