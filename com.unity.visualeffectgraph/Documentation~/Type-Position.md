# Position

A world-space or local-space three-component position vector. When the Visual Effect Graph transforms a Position, it takes translation, rotation, and scale into account. This is different to a [Vector](Type-Vector.md) because when the Visual Effect Graph transforms a Vector, it only takes rotation and scale into account.
