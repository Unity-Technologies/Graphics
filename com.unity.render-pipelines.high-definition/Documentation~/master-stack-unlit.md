# Unlit

The Unlit Master Stack lets you create shaders that aren't affected by lighting.

## Creating an Unlit Shader Graph

To create an Unlit material in Shader Graph, you can either:

* Modify an existing Shader Graph.

    1. Open the Shader Graph in the Shader Editor.
    2. In **Graph Settings**, select the **HDRP** Target. If there isn't one, go to **Active Targets,** click the **Plus** button and select **HDRP**.
    3. In the **Material** drop-down, select **Unlit**.

* Create a new Shader Graph. Go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Shader Graph** > **HDRP** and select **Unlit Shader Graph**.

## Contexts

[!include[](snippets/master-stacks-contexts-intro.md)]

### Vertex Context

#### Default

When you create a new Unlit Master Stack, the Vertex Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-position.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-normal.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-tangent.md)]
</table>

#### Relevant

Depending on the [Graph Settings](#graph-settings) you use, Shader Graph can add the following Blocks to the Vertex Context:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/tessellation-factor.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/tessellation-displacement.md)]

### Fragment Context

#### Default

When you create a new Unlit Master Stack, the Fragment Context contains the following Blocks by default:
