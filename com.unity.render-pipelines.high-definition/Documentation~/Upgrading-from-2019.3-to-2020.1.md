# Upgrading HDRP from Unity 2019.3 to Unity 2020.1

In the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), some features work differently between major versions of Unity. This document helps you upgrade HDRP from Unity 2019.3 to 2020.1.

## Scene View Camera Settings

From Unity 2020.1, the HDRP-specific settings of the scene view camera (anti-aliasing mode and stop NaNs) can be found in the same pop-up window as the standard scene camera settings, which are accessible by clicking the scene camera button on the toolbar of the scene window. These settings were previously in the HDRP preferences window (Edit > Preferences).
