# Render graph

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) makes extensive use of the [render graph system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/render-graph-system.html) in its implementation. This means that if you want to extend HDRP and implement your own render pipeline features, you need to learn how the render graph system works and how to write rendering code using it. For information on the render graph system and how to use it to write render pipeline features, see the [render graph system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/render-graph-system.html) documentation.
