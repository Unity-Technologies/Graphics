This page contains an overview of new features, improvements, and issues resolved in version 14 of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), embedded in Unity 2022.2.

## Added

### Ray Tracing Acceleration Structure Culling

In order to control the cost of building the ray tracing acceleration structure, new parameters have been added to the [Ray Tracing Settings](Ray-Tracing-Settings.md) volume component that allow you to define the algorithm that is going to perform the culling.

HDRP can either extend the camera frustum, perform sphere culling or skip the culling step.
