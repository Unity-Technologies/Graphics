# More Options

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) components expose standard properties by default that are suitable for most use-cases. To fine-tune the behavior of your components, you can manually expose **more options** .

## Exposing more options

Components that include more options have a cog icon to the right of each property section header. Click this cog icon to expose more options for that property section. For example, the [Light component’s](Light-Component.html) **General** section includes more options:

When you click the plus icon, Unity exposes more options for the **General** section. In this example,  the **Light Layer** property appears:
