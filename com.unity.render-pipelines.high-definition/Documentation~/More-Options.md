# More Options

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) components expose standard properties by default that are suitable for most use-cases. However, some HDRP components include **more options** which you can use to fine-tune the behavior of the component.

## Exposing more options

Not every component includes more options. If one does, it has a gear icon to the right of each property section header that includes more options. Click this gear icon to expose more options for that property section. For example, the [Light componentâ€™s](Light-Component.md) **General** section includes more options:

When you click the gear icon, Unity exposes more options for the **General** section. In this example,  the **Light Layer** property appears:
