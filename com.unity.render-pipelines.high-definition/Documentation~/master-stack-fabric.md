# Fabric

The Fabric Master Stack enables you to render various types of fabric in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). It uses either cotton wool or anisotropic silk as its base, and supports various additional effects such as [Subsurface Scattering](Subsurface-Scattering.md) to create realistic looking fabrics.

## Creating a Fabric Shader Graph

To create a Fabric material in Shader Graph, use one of the following methods:

* Modify an existing Shader Graph.

    1. Open the Shader Graph in the Shader Editor.
    2. In **Graph Settings**, select the **HDRP** Target. If there isn't one, go to **Active Targets,** click the **Plus** button, and select **HDRP**.
    3. In the **Material** drop-down, select **Fabric**.

* Create a new Shader Graph. Go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Shader Graph** > **HDRP** and click **Fabric Shader Graph**.

## Contexts

### Vertex Context

#### Default

When you create a new Fabric Master Stack, the Vertex Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-position.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-normal.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-tangent.md)]
</table>

#### Relevant

Depending on the [Graph Settings](#graph-settings) you use, Shader Graph can add the following Blocks to the Vertex Context:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
