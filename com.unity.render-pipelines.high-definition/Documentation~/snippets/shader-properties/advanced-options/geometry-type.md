<tr>
<td>**Geometry Type**</td>
<td>Indicates what geometry is used to represent the hair, which allows the shading model to make informed approximations. The shading model approximates the hair fiber differently in each of the following representations:
<br/>&#8226; **Cards**: Hair fibers are projected onto simplified proxy geometry called "cards".
<br/>&#8226; **Strands**: Hair fibers are represented by screen-aligned ribbons or tubes.</td>
