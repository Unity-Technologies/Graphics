<tr>
<td>**Scattering Mode**</td>
<td>Indicates the light scattering method in a volume of hair. Requires the **Physical** Material Type and **Strands** Geometry Type to use:
<br/>&#8226; **Approximate**: Fall back to a simplified diffuse component to approximate hair color. This is generally acceptable for high-absorbent (dark) hair. This is the default for both Material types.
<br/>&#8226; **Advanced**: Simulate the scattering of light through a volume of hair strands. This is important for depicting low-absorbent (light) hair. Adds the **Strand Probe Volume** parameter.</td>
