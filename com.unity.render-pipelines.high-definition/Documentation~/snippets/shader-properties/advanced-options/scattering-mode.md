<tr>
<td>**Scattering Mode**</td>
<td>Indicates the method by which the scattering of light is calculated in a volume of hair. Requires the "Marschner" Material Type and "Strands" Geometry Type to use:
<br/>&#8226; **Approximate**: Fall back to a simplified diffuse component to approximate hair color. This is generally acceptable for high-absorbent (dark) hair.
<br/>&#8226; **Advanced**: Simulate the scattering of light through a volume of hair strands. This is important for depicting low-absorbent (light) hair. Adds the Strand Probe Volume block parameter.</td>
