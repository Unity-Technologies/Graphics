<td>**Double Sided Mode**</td>
<td>Specifies how HDRP renders the faces of polygons in the mesh geometry. The options are:<br/>&#8226; Disabled: Only renders one face of the polygons.<br/>&#8226; Enabled: Renders both faces of the polygons. In this mode, the normal of the back face is the same as the front face.<br/>&#8226; Flipped Normals: Renders both faces of the polygons. In this mode, the normal of the back face is 180Â° of the front-facing normal. This also applies to the material, which means that it looks the same on both sides of the geometry.<br/>&#8226; Mirrored Normals: Renders both faces of the polygons. In this mode, the normal of the back face mirrors the front-facing normal. This also applies to the material, which means that it inverts on the back face. This is useful when you want to keep the same shape on both sides of the geometry, for example, for leaves.<br/><br/>For more information about this feature, see [Double-sided](../../../Double-Sided.md).</td>
