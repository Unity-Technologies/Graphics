<tr>
<td>- **Transparent Writes Motion Vectors**</td>
<td>Indicates whether HDRP writes motion vectors for transparent GameObjects that use this Material. This allows HDRP to process effects like motion blur for transparent objects. For more information on motion vectors, see the [motion vectors documentation](../../../Motion-Vectors.md).<br/>This property only appears if you set **Surface Type** to **Transparent**.</td>
