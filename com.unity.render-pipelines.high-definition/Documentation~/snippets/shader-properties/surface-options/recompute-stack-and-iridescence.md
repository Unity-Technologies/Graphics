<tr>
<td>**Recompute Stack And Iridescence**</td>
<td>Indicates whether the StackLit shader simulates its coat/layer effect for each [Light](../../../Light-Component.md) individually, rather than once for all Lights at the same time. Note this only applies to [punctual](../../../Glossary.md#punctual-lights), directional, and spot Lights. Enabling this option increases the resource intensity of the shader, so only use it when necessary (for example, when **Honor Per Light Max Smoothness** is enabled).</td>
