<td>**Material Type**</td>
<td>Specifies the method HDRP uses to calculate the lighting in the eye's iris:<br/>&#8226; **Eye**: Uses a low resource-intensity method to calculate caustics.<br/>&#8226; **Eye Cinematic**: Refracts incoming light to create more realistic lighting. This is the algorithm used in [The Heretic](https://blogs.unity3d.com/tag/the-heretic). This method is more resource-intensive than **Eye**.<br/>&#8226; **Eye Cinematic With Caustic**: Uses refracted light direction and caustic approximation to shade the iris. This is the algorithm used in [Enemies](https://unity.com/demos/enemies). This method is the the most resource intensive.</td>
