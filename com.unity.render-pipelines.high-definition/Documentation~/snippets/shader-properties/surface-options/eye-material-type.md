<td>Specifies the method HDRP uses to calculate caustics in the eye's iris. Currently, the quality difference between the two methods is marginal and the best one for your project depends on the context. The options are:<br/>&#8226; Eye: A low resource-intensity caustic calculation method.<br/>&#8226; Eye Cinematic: Produces a more realistic caustic effect. This is the same caustic calculation algorithm as used in [The Heretic](https://blogs.unity3d.com/tag/the-heretic). This method is more resource-intensive than Eye.</td>
