<tr>
<td>**Material Type**</td>
<td>Specifies a type for the material. This allows you to customize the material with different settings depending on the type you select. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Subsurface Scattering**: Applies the [subsurface scattering](../../../Subsurface-Scattering.md) workflow to the material. Subsurface scattering simulates the way light interacts with and penetrates translucent objects, such as skin or plant leaves. When light penetrates the surface of a subsurface scattering material, it scatters and blurs before exiting the surface at a different point.<br/>&#8226; **Standard**: Applies the basic metallic Shader workflow to the material. This is the default **Material Type**.<br/>&#8226; **Translucent**: Applies the Translucent workflow to the material. Use this **Material Type**, and a thickness map, to simulate a translucent material. In contrast to **Subsurface Scattering** materials, **Translucent** materials do not blur light that transmits through the material.<br/><br/>For more information about the feature and for the list of properties each **Material Type** exposes, see the [Material Type documentation](../../../Material-Type.md).  </td>
