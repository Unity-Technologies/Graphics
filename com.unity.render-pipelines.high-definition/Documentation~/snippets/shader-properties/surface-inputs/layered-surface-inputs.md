| **Property**                                 | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Layer Count**                              | Use the slider to set the number of layers this Material uses. You can set up to four layers. |
| **Layer Mask**                               | Assign a Texture to the field to manage the visibility of each layer. If you do not assign a Texture, the Material uses the maximum value for every channel.<br/>&#8226; Alpha channel for the **Main Layer**.<br/>&#8226; Red channel for **Layer 1**.<br/>&#8226; Green channel for **Layer 2**.<br/>&#8226; Blue channel for **Layer** |
| **BlendMask UV Mapping**                     | Use the drop-down to select the type of UV mapping that HDRP uses to map the **Layer Mask**.<br/>&#8226; Unity manages four UV channels for a vertex: **UV0**, **UV1**, **UV2**, and **UV3**.<br/>&#8226; **Planar:** A planar projection from top to bottom.<br/>&#8226; **Triplanar**: A planar projection in three directions:X-axis: Left to rightY-axis: Top to bottomZ-axis: Front to back Unity blends these three projections together to produce the final result. |
| **World Scale**                              | Set the world-space size of the Texture in meters. If you set this to **1**, then HDRP maps the Texture to 1 meter in world space.If you set this to **2**, then HDRP maps the Texture to 0.5 meters in world space.This property only appears when you select **Planar** or **Triplanar** from the **BlendMask UV Mapping** drop-down. |
| **Tiling**                                   | Set an **X** and **Y** tile rate for the **Layer Mask** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to tile the Texture assigned to the **Layer Mask** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Offset**                                   | Set an **X** and **Y** offset for the **Layer Mask** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to offset the Texture assigned to the **Layer Mask** from the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Vertex Color Mode**                        | Use the drop-down to select the method HDRP uses to combine the **Layer Mask** to manager layer visibility.<br/>&#8226; **None**: Only the **Layer Mask** affects visibility. HDRP does not combine it with vertex colors.<br/>&#8226; **Multiply**: Multiplies the vertex colors from a layer with the corresponding values from the channel in the **Layer Mask** that represents that layer. The default value for a pixel in the mask is 1. Multiplying the vertex colors of a layer by the **Layer Mask** reduces the intensity of that layer, unless the value in the **Layer Mask** is 1.<br/>&#8226; **Add**: Remaps vertex color values to between 0 and 1, and then adds them to the corresponding values from the channel in the **Layer Mask** that represents that layer. **Layer Mask** values between 0 and 0.5 reduce the effect of that layer, values between 0.5 and 1 increase the effect of that layer. |
| **Main Layer Influence**                     | Enable the checkbox to allow the **Main Layer** to influence the albedo, normal, and height of **Layer 1**, **Layer 2**, and **Layer 3**. You can change the strength of the influence for each layer. |
| **Use Height Based Blend**                   | Enable the checkbox to blend the layers with a heightmap. HDRP then evaluates the height of each layer to check whether to display that layer or the layer above. |
| **Height Transition**                        | Use the slider to set the transition blend size between the Materials in each layer. |
| **Lock Layers 123 Tiling With Object Scale** | Enable the checkbox to multiply the Material's tiling rate by the scale of the GameObject. This keeps the appearance of the heightmap consistent when you scale the GameObject. |
