<td>**Transmittance Color**</td>
<td>

Specifies the color this material tints light which passes through it. You can assign a Texture to handle this colorization on a per pixel basis and/or use the color picker to set a global color. If you assign a Texture and set a color, the final color is a combination of the Texture you assign and the color you select.<br />This property only appears when you select **Box**, **Sphere**, or **Thin** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down.
