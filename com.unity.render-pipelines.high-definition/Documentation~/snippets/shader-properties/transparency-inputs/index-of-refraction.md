<tr>
<td>**Index of Refraction**</td>
<td>

The index of refraction for this material. The index of refraction defines the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in the medium of the material. Higher values produce more intense refraction.<br />This property only appears when you select **Box**, **Sphere** or **Thin** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down.
