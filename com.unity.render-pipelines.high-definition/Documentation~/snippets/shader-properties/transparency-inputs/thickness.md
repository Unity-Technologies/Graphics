<td>**Thickness**</td>
<td>

The overall thickness of the refractive object between 0 and 1. The thicker the material, the more visible the effect is.<br />This property only appears when you set **Refraction Model** to either **Box** or **Sphere**. For the **Thin** model, HDRP implicitly sets this value to the equivalent of 5cm.
