| **Detail Map**                   | Specifies a [channel-packed Texture](../../Glossary.md#channel-packing) that HDRP uses to add micro details into the Material. The Detail Map uses the following channel settings:<br />&#8226; **Red**: Stores the grey scale as albedo.<br />&#8226; **Green**: Stores the green channel of the detail normal map.<br />&#8226; **Blue**: Stores the detail smoothness.<br />&#8226; **Alpha**: Stores the red channel of the detail normal map.<br />For more information on channel-packed Textures and the detail map, see [detail map](../../Mask-Map-and-Detail-Map.md#detail-map). |
| **Detail UV Mapping**            | Specifies the type of UV map to use for the **Detail Map**. If the Material’s **Base UV mapping** property is set to **Planar** or **Triplanar**, the **Detail UV Mapping** is also set to **Planar** or **Triplanar**.<br />The **Detail Map** Texture modifies the appearance of the Material so, by default, HDRP applies the **Tiling** and **Offset** of the **Base UV Map** to the **Detail Map** to synchronize the **Detail Map** and the rest of the Material Textures. HDRP then applies the **Detail Map** **Tiling** and **Offset** properties on top of the **Base Map Tiling** and **Offset**. For example, on a plane, if the **Tiling** for **Base UV Mapping** is 2, and this value is also 2, then the **Detail Map** Texture tiles by 4 on the plane.<br />This workflow allows you to change the **Tiling** of the Texture on the Material, without having to set the **Tiling** of the **Detail UV** too.<br />To separate the **Detail UV Map** from the **Base UV Map** to set it independently, disable the **Lock to Base Tiling/Offset** checkbox. |
| **- Lock to Base Tiling/Offset** | Indicates whether the **Base UV Map**’s **Tiling** and **Offset** properties affect the **Detail Map**. When enabled, HDRP multiplies these properties by the **Detail UV Map**’s **Tiling** and **Offset** properties respectively. To separate the **Detail UV Map** from the **Base UV Map** to set it independently, disable this checkbox. |
| **Tiling**                       | The per-axis tile rate for the **Detail Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to tile the Texture assigned to the **Detail Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Offset**                       | The per-axis offset for the **Detail Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to offset the Texture assigned to the **Detail Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Detail Albedo Scale**          | Modules the albedo of the detail map (red channel) between 0 and 2. This is an overlay effect. The default value is 1 and applies no scale. |
| **Detail Normal Scale**          | Modulates the intensity of the detail normal map (green and alpha channel), between 0 and 2. The default value is 1 and applies no scale. |
| **Detail Smoothness Scale**      | Modulate the intensity of the detail smoothness map (blue channel) between 0 and 2. This is an overlay effect. The default value is 1 and applies no scale. |
