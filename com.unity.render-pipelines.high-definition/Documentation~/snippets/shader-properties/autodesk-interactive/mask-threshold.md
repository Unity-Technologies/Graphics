<tr>
<td>**MaskThreshold**</td>
<td>The opacity threshold HDRP uses to to determine which areas of the **MaskMap** render as transparent or completely opaque. For example, for a **MaskThreshold** value of 0.5, a pixel in the **MaskMap** with a value of 0.6 appears completely opaque and a pixel with a value of 0.4 appears completely transparent.</td>
