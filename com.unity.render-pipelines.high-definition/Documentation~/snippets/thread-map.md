# Thread maps

The Fabric shaders can use a thread map for the high-frequency details that fabrics exhibit. This is similar to the [detail map](../Mask-Map-And-Detail-Map.md#DetailMap) found in HDRP's Lit shaders. The Thread Map input is channel-packed to optimise memory and is arranged in a way to optimise precision for the normal map. The Fabric Material Sample includes some pre-authored Thread Maps for you.

The format of the thread map texture:

- **Red**: Ambient Occlusion
- **Green & Alpha**: Normals.
- **Blue**: Smoothness.

Under the hood, the fabric shaders apply thread maps using a SubGraph Operator. To learn more about the thread map implementation, or to use it yourself:

1. In the Unity Editor, open a Shader Graph assetâ€™s Shader Editor.
2. Right-click anywhere in the graph view, and select **Create Node**.
3. Navigate to **Utility > High Definition Render Pipeline > Fabric > Thread Map Detail** and select. This adds the Thread Map operator into your graph.
