This Master Stack material type has its own set of Graph Settings. Because of the relationship between settings and Blocks, this has consequences on which Blocks are relevant to the Graph. This section contains information on the Blocks this Master Stack material type adds by default, and which Blocks set properties for this Master Stack material type's Graph Settings.

For more information about the relationship between Graph Settings and Blocks, see [Contexts and Blocks](../ss-contexts-and-blocks.md).
