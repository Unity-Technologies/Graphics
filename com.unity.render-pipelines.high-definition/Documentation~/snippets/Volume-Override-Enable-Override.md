To use this feature in your Scene, you must first enable it for your project and then enable it for your Cameras. To enable features in your project, you use the [HDRP Asset](../HDRP-Asset.md) and to enable features for your Cameras, you use [Frame Settings](../Frame-Settings.md). You can enable features either for all Cameras, using the Default Frame Settings, or for specific Cameras, by overriding each Camera's individual Frame Settings.
