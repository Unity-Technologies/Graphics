<tr>
<td>**Ambient Occlusion**</td>
<td>The material's ambient occlusion. This approximates occlusion for a fragment on a GameObjectâ€™s surface that has been cast by details present in the Material but not the mesh geometry. A value of 0 means the fragment is completely occluded and appears black. A value of 1 means the fragment is not occluded at all, and the ambient color does not change.</td>
