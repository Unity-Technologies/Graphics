<td>The value to clamp the color flip phase to. This is at the grazing angle endpoint of the angular range. This makes it so that the oscillations only “elongate” towards the 0 degree viewing angle, which makes a lowered thickness more apparent.</td>
<td>&#8226; **Material Type** set to **StackLit** <br/>&#8226; **Iridescence** enabled <br/>&#8226; **Coat** enabled.</td>
