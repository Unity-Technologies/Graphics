<td>**Transmittance**</td>
<td>The fraction of specular lighting that penetrates the hair from behind. This is on a per-color channel basis, so you can use this property to set the color of penetrating light. Set this to (0, 0, 0) to stop any light from penetrating through the hair. Set this to (1, 1, 1) to have a strong effect with a lot of white light transmitting through the hair.</td>
