# Volume Profile

A Volume Profile is a [Scriptable Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) which contains properties that [Volumes](Volumes.md) use to determine how to render the Scene environment for Cameras they affect. A Volume references a Volume Profile in its **Profile** field and uses values from the Volume Profile it references.

A Volume Profile organizes its properties into structures which control different environment settings. These structures all have default values that you can use, but you can use [Volume Overrides](Volume-Components.md) to override these values and customize the environment settings.

## Creating and customizing a Volume Profile

There are multiple ways to create a Volume Profile. Unity creates, and links, a Volume Profile automatically when you create a **Scene Settings** GameObject (menu: **Rendering > Scene Settings**). You can also create a Volume Profile manually. Navigate to menu: **Assets > Create > Volume Profile**.

Open the Volume Profile in the Inspector to edit its properties. To do this, you can either:

&#8226; Select the Volume Profile in on the Assets folder.

&#8226; Select a GameObject with a Volume component that has a Volume Profile set in its **Profile** field.

When you view the Volume Profile in the Inspector, you can only see values from the Volume overrides that the Volume Profile includes; the Volume Profile hides all other values. You must add Volume override components in order to edit the default properties of the Volume Profile. Click on the **Add Override** button and select which Volume override you want to add to the Volume Profile. For example, click on the **Add Override** button and select the **Screen Space Reflection** Volume override. This exposes properties relating to the screen space reflection (SSR) effect in HDRP. Default values for SSR already exist and you can use SSR in your Unity Project with these default values, without adding the SSR Volume override to a Volume Profile.
