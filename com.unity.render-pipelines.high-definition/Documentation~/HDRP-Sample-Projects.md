# HDRP Sample Projects

To explore more complex usages of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), you have access to several fully interactive Unity Projects.

These projects are hosted on Unity Technology's GitHub.

When you clone the Project's repository, make sure to use git or a git client. This is because if you use the Green button on the GitHub website, it does not download all the Assets.

## Fontainebleau

This Project demonstrates how to use Photogrammetry to create game ready Assets. From Unity 2020.1, Fontainebleau will no longer receive updates; Unity 2019.4 is the last supported version.

Graphics Features used :

* Shader Graph (Wind animation)
* Contact Shadows
* SubSurface Scattering, Hair and Fabric Shaders (third person character)
* Volumetric fog
