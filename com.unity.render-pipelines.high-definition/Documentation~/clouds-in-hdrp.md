# Clouds in HDRP

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) includes two cloud solutions that you can use in your Unity Project. The two solutions are:

- [Cloud Layer](Override-Cloud-Layer.md)
- [Volumetric Clouds](Override-Volumetric-Clouds.md)

You can use both solutions together. In this case, you can use Volumetric Clouds for closer, interactable (receives fog and volumetric light) clouds, and Cloud Layer for distant clouds that are part of the skybox.

__Note:__ Cloud Layer and Volumetric Clouds do not support Planet Center Position.
