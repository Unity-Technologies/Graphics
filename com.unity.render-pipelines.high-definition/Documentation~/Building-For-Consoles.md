# Building your Project for consoles

To build a Project for the **PlayStation 4**, **PlayStation 5**, **Game Core Xbox Series**, **Game Core Xbox One** or **Xbox One**, you need to install an additional package for each platform you want to support. The packages for each platform are:

- **PlayStation 4**: com.unity.render-pipelines.ps4
- **PlayStation 5**: com.unity.render-pipelines.ps5
- **Xbox One**: com.unity.render-pipelines.xboxone
- **Game Core Xbox Series**: com.unity.render-pipelines.gamecore
- **Game Core Xbox One**: com.unity.render-pipelines.gamecore

## Platform package installation

To install a platform package, download it from the relevant platform developer forum (you cannot get these packages from the package registry or Package Manager). To do this:

1. Download the package for the platform that your Project targets. You can find each package on its respective platform developer forum. The download link is in the same location as the Unity installer for that platform.
2. Use the Package Manager to install the package locally. For information on how to install local packages, see[ Installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).
