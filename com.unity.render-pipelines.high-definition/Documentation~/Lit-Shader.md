# Lit Shader

The Lit Shader lets you easily create realistic materials in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). It includes options for effects like subsurface scattering, iridescence, vertex or pixel displacement, and decal compatibility. For more information about Materials, Shaders, and Textures, see the [Unity User Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shaders.html).

## Creating a Lit Material

To create a new Lit Shader Material, navigate to your Project's Asset window, right-click in the Asset Window and select **Create > Material**. This adds a new Material to your Unity Project’s Asset folder. When you create new Materials in HDRP, they use the Lit Shader by default.

## Lit Shader properties

### Surface Options

**Surface Options** control the overall look of your Material's surface and how Unity renders the Material on screen.

| **Property**                                | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Surface Type**                            | Use the drop-down to define whether your Material supports transparency or not.<br /><br />**Opaque**: Select this option to simulate a completely solid Material with no light penetration.<br /><br />**Transparent**: Select this option to simulate a translucent Material that light can penetrate, such as clear plastic or glass. Materials with a **Transparent Surface Type** are more resource intensive to render than Materials with an **Opaque** **Surface Type**. Setting **Surface Type** to transparent exposes the [Transparency Inputs section](#TransparencyInputs).HDRP exposes more properties, depending on the **Surface Type** you select. |
| **- Rendering Pass**                        | Use the drop-down to set the rendering pass that HDRP processes this Material in.<br /><br />**Before Refraction**: Draws the GameObject before the refraction pass. This means that HDRP includes this Material when it processes refraction. To expose this option, select **Transparent** from the **Surface Type** drop-down.<br /><br />**Default**: Draws the GameObject in the default opaque or transparent rendering pass pass, depending on the **Surface Type**.<br /><br />**Low Resolution**: Draws the GameObject in half resolution after the **Default** pass. |
| **- Blending Mode**                         | Use the drop-down to determine how HDRP calculates the color of each pixel of the transparent Material. This changes the method that HDRP uses to blend the Material with background pixels.**Alpha**: Uses the Material’s alpha value to change how transparent an object is. 0 is fully transparent. 1 appears fully opaque, but the Material is still rendered during the Transparent render pass. This is useful for visuals that you want to be fully visible but to also fade over time, like clouds.**Additive**: Adds the Material’s RGB values to the background color. The alpha channel of the Material modulates the intensity. A value of 0 adds nothing and a value of 1 adds 100% of the Material color to the background color.**Premultiply**: Assumes that you have already multiplied the RGB values of the Material by the alpha channel. This gives better results than **Alpha** blending when filtering images or composing different layers. |
| **- Preserve specular lighting**            | Enable this checkbox to preserve the specular elements on the transparent surface, such as sunbeams shining off glass or water. |
| **- Sorting Priority**                      | Allows you to change the rendering order of overlaid transparent surfaces. For more information and an example of usage, see the [Material sorting documentation](Renderer-And-Material-Priority.html#SortingByMaterial). |
| **- Receive Fog**                           | Enable this checkbox to allow fog to affect the transparent surface. When disabled, HDRP does not take this Material into account when it calculates the fog in the Scene. |
| **- Back Then Front Rendering**             | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP render this Material in two separate draw calls. HDRP renders the back face in the first draw call and the front face in the second. |
| **-** **Transparent depth prepass**         | Enable this checkbox to add polygons from the transparent surface to the depth buffer to improve their sorting. |
| **-** **Transparent depth postpass**        | Enable this checkbox to add polygons to the depth buffer that post-processing uses. |
| **-** **Transparent Writes Motion Vectors** | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP write velocity vectors for transparent GameObjects that use this Material. |
| **Double-Sided**                            | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP render both faces of the polygons in your geometry. Enabling this property exposes the [Normal Mode](#NormalMode) property. |
| **- Normal Mode**                           | <a name="NormalMode"></a>Use the drop-down to select the mode that HDRP uses to calculate the normals for the back facing geometry.<br /><br />**Flip**: The normal of the back face is 180° of the front facing normal. This also applies to the Material which means that it looks the same on both sides of the geometry.<br /><br />**Mirror**: The normal of the back face mirrors the front facing normal. This also applies to the Material which means that it inverts on the back face. This is useful when you want to keep the same shapes on both sides of the geometry, for example, for leaves.<br /><br />**None**: The normal of the back face is the same as the front face. |
| **Alpha Clipping**                          | Enable this checkbox to make this Material act like a Cutout Shader. Enable **Alpha Clipping** to create a transparent effect with hard edges between the opaque and transparent areas. HDRP achieves this effect by not rendering pixels with alpha values below the value you specify in the **Threshold** field. Enabling this feature exposes more properties. |
| **-** **Threshold**                         | Set the alpha value limit that HDRP uses to determine whether it should render each pixel. If the alpha value of the pixel is equal to or higher than the limit then HDRP renders the pixel. If the value is lower than the limit then HDRP does not render the pixel. The default value is 0.5. |
| **-** **Use Shadow Threshold**              | Enable this checkbox to set another threshold value for alpha clipping shadows. |
| **-** **- Shadow Threshold**                | Set the alpha value limit that HDRP uses to determine whether it should render shadows for a pixel. |
| **- Prepass Threshold**                     | Use this slider to set the alpha value limit that HDRP uses for the Transparent depth prepass. This works in the same way as the main **Threshold** property described above. To expose this property, enable the **Transparent Depth Prepass** checkbox. |
| **- Postpass Threshold**                    | Use this slider to set the alpha value limit that HDRP uses for the transparent depth postpass. This works in the same way as the main **Threshold** property described above. To expose this property, enable the **Transparent Depth Postpass** checkbox. |
| **Material Type**                           | Allows you to give your Material a type, which allows you to customize it with different settings depending on the **Material Type** you select.<br /><br />**Subsurface scattering**: Applies the subsurface scattering workflow to the Material. subsurface scattering simulates the way light interacts with and penetrates translucent objects, such as skin or plant leaves. When light penetrates the surface of a subsurface scattering Material, it scatters and blurs before exiting the surface at a different point.<br /><br />**Standard**: Applies the basic metallic Shader workflow to the Material. This is the default **Material Type**.<br /><br />**Anisotropy**: Applies the anisotropic workflow to the Material. The highlights of Anisotropic surfaces change in appearance as you view the Material from different angles. Use this **Material Type** to create Materials with anisotropic highlights. For example, brushed metal or velvet.<br /><br />**Iridescence**: Applies the Iridescence workflow to the Material. Iridescent surfaces appear to gradually change color as the angle of view or angle of illumination changes. Use this **Material Type** to create Materials like soap bubbles, iridescent metal, or insect wings.<br /><br />**Specular Color**: Applies the Specular Color workflow to the Material. Use this **Material Type** to create Materials with a coloured specular highlight. This is similar to the [built-in Specular Shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterSpecular.html).<br /><br />**Translucent**: Applies the Translucent workflow to the Material. Use this **Material Type**, and a thickness map, to simulate a translucent Material. In contrast to **Subsurface Scattering** Materials, **Translucent** Materials do not blur light that transmits through the Material. Selecting different **Material Types** exposes more properties. |
| **- Transmission**                          | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP simulate the translucency of an object using a thickness map. Configure subsurface scattering and transmission settings using a [Diffusion Profile](Diffusion-Profile.html). For more information, see documentation on [Subsurface Scattering](Subsurface-Scattering.html). |
| **Receive Decals**                          | Enable this checkbox to allow HDRP to draw decals on this Material’s surface. |
| **Receive SSR**                             | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP include this Material when it processes the screen space reflection pass. |
| **Geometric Specular AA**                   | Enable this checkbox to tell HDRP to perform geometric anti-aliasing on this Material. This modifies the smoothness values on surfaces of curved geometry in order to remove specular artifacts. HDRP reduces the smoothness value by an offset depending on the intensity of the geometry curve. This is especially effective for high-density meshes with a high smoothness. |
| **- Screen Space Variance**                 | Use this slider to set the strength of the geometric specular anti-aliasing effect between 0 and 1. Higher values produce a blurrier result with less aliasing. To expose this property, enable the **Geometric Specular AA** checkbox. |
| **- Threshold**                             | Use this slider to set a maximum value for the offset that HDRP subtracts from the smoothness value to reduce artifacts. To expose this property, enable the **Geometric Specular AA** checkbox. |
| **Displacement Mode**                       | Use this drop-down to select the method that HDRP uses to alter the height of the Material’s surface.<br /><br />**None**: Select this option to apply no displacement to the Material.<br /><br />**Vertex Displacement**: Select this option to shift the Mesh’s vertices according to the **Height Map**.<br /><br />**Pixel Displacement**: Select this option to shift the pixels on the Mesh surface according to the **Height Map.**HDRP exposes extra properties depending on the mode you choose. |
| **- Lock with object scale**                | Enable this checkbox to alter the height of the displacement using the **Scale** of the **Transform**. This allows you to preserve the ratio between the amplitude of the displacement and the **Scale** of the **Transform**. To expose this property, select **Vertex Displacement** or **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Lock with height map tiling rate**      | Enable this checkbox to alter the amplitude of the displacement using the tiling of the **Height Map**. This allows you to preserve the ratio between the amplitude of the displacement and the scale of the **Height Map** Texture. To expose this property, select **Vertex Displacement** or **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Minimum steps**                         | Use this slider to set the minimum number of Texture samples that Unity uses to process pixel displacement. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Maximum steps**                         | Use this slider to set the maximum number of Texture samples that Unity uses to process pixel displacement. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Fading mip level start**                | Use this slider to set the mip level at which the pixel displacement effect begins to fade out. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Primitive length**                      | The length of the Mesh (in meters) on which Unity applies the displacement mapping. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Primitive width**                       | The width of the Mesh (in meters) on which Unity applies the displacement mapping. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Depth Offset**                          | Enable this checkbox to modify the depth buffer according to the displacement. This allows effects that use the depth buffer ([Contact Shadows](Contact-Shadows.html) for example) to capture pixel displacement details. To expose this property, select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |

### Vertex Animation

| **Property**                           | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Motion Vector For Vertex Animation** | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP write motion vectors for objects that use vertex animation. This removes the ghosting that vertex animation can cause. |

### Surface Inputs

| **Property**                          | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Base Map**                          | Assign a Texture that controls both the color and opacity of your Material. To assign a Texture to this field, click the radio button and select your Texture in the Select Texture window. Use the color picker to select the color of the Material. If you do not assign a Texture, this is the absolute color of the Material. If you do assign a Texture, the final color of the Material is a combination of the Texture you assign and the color you select. The alpha value of the color controls the transparency level for the Material if you select **Transparent** from the **Surface Type** drop-down. |
| **Metallic**                          | Use this slider to adjust how metal-like the surface of your Material is (between 0 and 1). When a surface is more metallic, it reflects the environment more and its albedo color becomes less visible. At full metallic level, environmental reflections fully drive the surface color. When a surface is less metallic, its albedo color is clearer and any surface reflections are visible on top of the surface color, rather than obscuring it. To expose this property, select **Standard**, **Anisotropy**, or **Iridescence** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Smoothness**                        | Use this slider to adjust the smoothness of your Material. Every light ray that hits a smooth surface bounces off at predictable and consistent angles. For a perfectly smooth surface that reflects light like a mirror, set this to a value of 1. Less smooth surfaces reflect light over a wider range of angles (because the light hits the bumps in the microsurface), so the reflections have less detail and spread across the surface in a more diffused pattern. To expose this property, unassign the Texture in the **Mask Map**. |
| **Smoothness Remapping**              | Use this min-max slider to remap the smoothness values from the **Mask Map** to the range you specify. Rather than [clamping](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html) values to the new range, Unity condenses the original range down to the new range uniformly. To expose this property, assign a **Mask Map**. |
| **Ambient Occlusion Remapping**       | Use this min-max slider to remap the ambient occlusion values from the **Mask Map** to the range you specify. Rather than [clamping](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html) values to the new range, Unity condenses the original range down to the new range uniformly. To expose this property, assign a **Mask Map**. |
| **Mask Map**                          | Assign a Texture that packs different Material maps into each of its RGBA channels. **Red**: Stores the metallic map.  **Green**: Stores the ambient occlusion map. **Blue**: Stores the detail mask map. **Alpha**: Stores the smoothness map. |
| **Normal Map Space**                  | Use this drop-down to select the type of Normal Map space that this Material uses.<br /><br />**TangentSpace**: Defines the normal map in UV space; use this to tile a Texture on a Mesh. The normal map Texture must be BC7, BC5, or DXT5nm format.<br /><br />**ObjectSpace**: Defines the normal maps in world space. Use this for planar-mapping objects like the terrain. The normal map must be an RGB Texture . |
| **Normal Map**                        | Assign a Texture that defines the normal map for this Material in tangent space. Use the slider to modulate the normal intensity between 0 and 8. To expose this property, select **TangentSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down. |
| **Normal Map OS**                     | Assign a Texture that defines the object space normal map for this Material. Use the handle to modulate the normal intensity between 0 and 8. To expose this property, select **ObjectSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down. |
| **Bent Normal Map**                   | Assign a Texture that defines the bent normal map for this Material in tangent space. HDRP uses bent normal maps to simulate more accurate ambient occlusion.  Note: Bent normal maps only work with diffuse lighting. To expose this property, select **TangentSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down.. |
| **Bent Normal Map OS**                | Assign a Texture that defines the bent normal map for this Material in object space. HDRP uses bent normal maps to simulate more accurate ambient occlusion. Note: Bent normal maps only work with diffuse lighting. To expose this property, select **ObjectSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down. |
| **Height Map**                        | Assign a Texture that defines the heightmap for this Material. Unity uses this map to displace this Material’s Mesh.<br /><br />To expose this property, select **Vertex Displacement** or **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down. |
| **- Parametrization**                 | Use the drop-down to select the parametrization method for the to use for the **Height Map**.<br />To expose this property, select **Vertex Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down and assign a **Height Map**. |
| **- Min**                             | Set the minimum value in the **Height Map**.<br />To expose this property, select **MinMax** from the **Parametrization** drop-down. |
| **- Max**                             | Set the maximum value in the **Height Map**.<br />To expose this property, select **MinMax** from the **Parametrization** drop-down. |
| **- Offset**                          | Set the offset that HDRP applies to the **Height Map**.<br />To expose this property, assign a **Height Map**. |
| **- Amplitude**                       | Set the amplitude of the **Height Map**.<br />To expose this property, select **Vertex Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down, or select **Pixel Displacement** from the **Displacement Mode** drop-down and **Amplitude** from the **Parametrization** drop-down. |
| **- Base**                            | Use this slider to set the base for the **Height Map**<br />To expose this property, select **Amplitude** from the **Parametrization** drop-down. |
| **Tangent Map**                       | Assign a Texture that defines the direction of the anisotropy effect of a pixel, in tangent space. This stretches the specular highlights in the given direction. To expose this property, select **ObjectSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down and **Anisotropy** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Tangent Map OS**                    | Assign a Texture that defines the direction of the anisotropy effect of a pixel, in object space. This stretches the specular highlights in the given direction. To expose this property, select **TangentSpace** from the **Normal Map Space** drop-down and **Anisotropy** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Diffusion Profile**                 | Assign a [Diffusion Profile](Diffusion-Profile.html) to drive the behavior of subsurface scattering. To quickly view the currently selected Diffusion Profile’s Inspector, double click the Diffusion Profile Asset in the assign field. If you do not assign a Diffusion Profile, HDRP does not process the subsurface scattering. To expose this property, select **Subsurface Scattering** or **Translucent** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Subsurface Mask**                   | Use this slider to set the strength of the screen-space blur effect. If you set a **Subsurface Mask Map**, this acts as a multiplier for that map. If you do not set a Subsurface Mask Map, this strengthens the entire subsurface scattering effect on this Material. To expose this property, select **Subsurface Scattering** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Subsurface Mask Map**               | Assign a grayscale Texture, with values from 0 to 1, that controls the strength of the blur effect across the Material. A texel with a value of 1 corresponds to full strength, while those with a value of 0 disables the Subsurface Scattering blur effect. To expose this property, select **Subsurface Scattering** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Thickness Map**                     | Assign a grayscale Texture, with values from 0 to 1, that correspond to the average thickness of the Mesh at the location of the texel. Higher values mean thicker areas, and thicker areas transmit less light. To expose this property, select **Subsurface Scattering** or **Translucent** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Thickness**                         | Use this slider to set the strength of the transmission effect. Multiplies the Thickness Map. To expose this property, select **Subsurface Scattering** or **Translucent** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Anisotropy**                        | Use this slider to set the direction of the anisotropy effect. Negative values make the effect vertical, and positive values make the effect horizontal. This stretches the specular highlights in the given direction. To expose this property, select **Anisotropy** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Anisotropy Map**                    | Assign a Texture, with values from 0 to 1, that controls the strength of the anisotropy effect. HDRP only uses the red channel of this Texture to calculate the strength of the effect. To expose this property, select **Anisotropy** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Iridescence Mask**                  | Assign a Texture, with values from 0 to 1, that controls the strength of the iridescence effect. A texel with a value of 1 corresponds to full strength, while those with a value of 0 disables the iridescence effect. To expose this property, select **Iridescence** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Iridescence Layer Thickness map**   | Assign a Texture, with values from 0 to 1, that controls the thickness of the iridescence. This modifies the color of the effect. To expose this property, select **Iridescence** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Iridescence Layer Thickness remap** | Use this min-max slider to remap the thickness values from the **Iridescence Layer Thickness map** to the range you specify. Rather than [clamping](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html) values to the new range, Unity condenses the original range down to the new range uniformly. To expose this property, select **Iridescence** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Specular Color**                    | Allows you to manually define the specular color. You can assign a Texture to define the specular color on a pixel level and use the color picker to select a global specular color for the Material. If you do both, HDRP multiplies each pixel of the Texture by the color you specify in the color picker. To expose this property, select **Specular Color** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Energy Conserving Specular Color**  | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP reduce the diffuse color of the Material if the specular effect is more intense. This makes the lighting of the Material more consistent, which makes the Material look more physically accurate. To expose this property, select **Specular Color** from the **Material Type** drop-down. |
| **Coat Mask**                         | Assign a Texture that defines the coat mask for this Material. HDRP uses this mask to simulate a clear coat effect on the Material to mimic Materials like car paint or plastics. The Coat Mask value is 0 by default, but you can use the handle to modulate the clear Coat Mask effect using a value between 0 and 1. |
| **Base UV Mapping**                   | Use the drop-down to select the type of UV mapping that HDRP uses to map Textures to this Material’s surface.<br /><br />Unity manages four UV channels for a vertex:**UV0**, **UV1**, **UV2**, and **UV3**.<br /><br />**Planar:** A planar projection from top to bottom.<br /><br />**Triplanar**: A planar projection in three directions:<br />X-axis: Left to right<br />Y-axis: Top to bottom<br />Z-axis: Front to back<br />Unity blends these three projections together to produce the final result. |
| **Tiling**                            | Set an **X** and **Y** UV tile rate for all of the Textures in the **Surface Inputs** section. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to tile these Textures across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Offset**                            | Set an **X** and **Y** UV offset for all of the Textures in the **Surface Inputs** section. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to offset these Textures across the Material’s surface, in object. |

### Detail Inputs

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Detail Map**                   | Assign a [channel-packed Texture](Glossary.html#ChannelPacking) that HDRP uses to add micro details into the Material. The Detail Map uses the following channel settings:<br /><br />**Red**: Stores the grey scale as albedo.<br /><br />**Green**: Stores the green channel of the detail normal map.<br /><br />**Blue**: Stores the detail smoothness.<br /><br />**Alpha**: Stores the red channel of the detail normal map. |
| **Detail UV Mapping**            | Use the drop-down to set the type of UV map to use for the **Detail Map**. If the Material’s **Base UV mapping** property is set to **Planar** or **Triplanar**, the **Detail UV Mapping** is also set to **Planar** or **Triplanar**.<br />The **Detail Map** Texture modifies the appearance of the Material so, by default, HDRP applies the **Tiling** and **Offset** of the **Base UV Map** to the **Detail Map** to synchronize the **Detail Map** and the rest of the Material Textures. HDRP then applies the **Detail Map** **Tiling** and **Offset** properties on top of the **Base Map Tiling** and **Offset**. For example, on a plane, if the **Tiling** for **Base UV Mapping** is 2, and this value is also 2, then the **Detail Map** Texture tiles by 4 on the plane.<br />This workflow allows you to change the **Tiling** of the Texture on the Material, without having to set the **Tiling** of the **Detail UV** too.<br />To separate the **Detail UV Map** from the **Base UV Map** to set it independently, disable the **Lock to Base Tiling/Offset** checkbox. |
| **- Lock to Base Tiling/Offset** | Enable this checkbox to make the **Base UV Map**’s **Tiling** and **Offset** properties affect the **Detail Map**. HDRP multiplies these properties by the **Detail UV Map**’s **Tiling** and **Offset** properties respectively. To separate the **Detail UV Map** from the **Base UV Map** to set it independently, disable this checkbox. |
| **Tiling**                       | Set an **X** and **Y** tile rate for the **Detail Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to tile the Texture assigned to the **Detail Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Offset**                       | Set an **X** and **Y** offset for the **Detail Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to offset  the Texture assigned to the **Detail Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Detail Albedo Scale**          | Use this slider to modulate the albedo of the detail map (red channel) between 0 and 2. This is an overlay effect. |
| **Detail Normal Scale**          | Use this slider to modulate the intensity of the detail normal map, between 0 and 2. The default value is 1 and has no scale. |
| **Detail Smoothness Scale**      | Use this slider modulate the smoothness of the detail map (blue channel) between 0 and 2, like an overlay effect. The default value is 1 and has no scale. |

### Transparency Inputs

To expose this section in the Material Inspector, set the **Surface Type** to **Transparent**.

| **Property**                            | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Refraction Model**                    | Use the drop-down to select the model that HDRP uses to process refraction.<br /><br />**None**: No refraction occurs. Select this option to disable refraction.<br /><br />**Box**: A box-shaped model where incident light enters through a flat surface and leaves through a flat surface. Select this option for hollow surfaces.<br /><br />**Sphere**: A sphere-shaped model that produces a magnifying glass-like effect to refraction. Select this option for solid surfaces. |
| **- Index of Refraction**               | Use this slider to set the index of refraction for this Material. The index of refraction defines the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in the medium of the Material. Higher values produce more intense refraction. To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **- Refraction Thickness**              | Use this slider to set the overall thickness of the refractive object between 0 and 1. To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **- Refraction Thickness Map**          | Assign a Texture that defines the thickness map for this Material. This map controls the thickness of the object on a per-pixel level. To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **- Refraction Thickness Multiplier**   | Scales the thickness of the object. To calculate the thickness of the refractive object, HDRP multiplies this value by the **Refraction Thickness Map** and the **Refraction Thickness.**To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **- Transmittance Color**               | Refractive Materials can colorize light which passes through them. Assign a Texture to handle this colorization on a per pixel basis.Use the color picker to set a global color to handle the colorization. If you assign a Texture and set a color, the final color of the Material is a combination of the Texture you assign and the color you select. To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **- Transmittance Absorption Distance** | Set the thickness of the object at which the **Transmittance Color** affects incident light at full strength. To expose this property, select **Box** or **Sphere** from the **Refraction Model** drop-down. |
| **Distortion**                          | Enable this checkbox to distort the light passing through this transparent Material. When enabled, this exposes the following properties. |
| **- Distortion Blend Mode**             | Set the mode HDRP uses to blend overlaid distortion surfaces. |
| **- Distortion Depth Test**             | Check this box to make GameObjects that are closer to the Camera hide the distortion effect, otherwise you can always see the effect. If you do not enable this feature then the distortion effect appears on top of the rendering. |
| **- Distortion Vector Map**             | Make HDRP use the red and green channels of this Texture to calculate distortion for the light passing through the Material. HDRP also uses the blue channel to manage the blur intensity between 0 and 1. By default, a texture has values between 0 and 1. To be able to produce distortion in either direction, you must remap the distortion texture between -1 and 1. HDRP provides two values you can use to remap this distortion texture. It takes the original value from the map and multiplies it by the value on the left then adds the value on the right. For example, to remap the original values, from 0 to 1, to -1 to 1, enter 2 for the first value and -1 for the second value. |
| **- Distortion Scale**                  | A multiplier for the distortion effect on the light passing through the Material. Set this to a value higher than 1 to amplify the effect. |
| **- Distortion Blur Scale**             | A multiplier for the distortion blur. Set this to a value higher than 1 to amplify the blur. |
| **- Distortion Blur Remapping**         | Use this handle to clamp the values of the blue channel of the Distortion Vector Map. Use this to refine the blur setting. |

### Emissive inputs

| **Property**                    | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use Emission Intensity**      | Enable this checkbox to use a separate LDR color and intensity value to set the emission color for this Material. Disable this checkbox to only use an HDR color to handle the color and emission color intensity. When enabled, this exposes the **Emission Intensity** property. |
| **Emission Map**                | Assign a Texture that this Material uses for emission. You can also use the color picker to select a color that HDRP multiplies by the Texture. If you do not set an emission texture then HDRP only uses the HDR color to calculate the final emissive color of the Material. You can set the intensity of the HDR color within the HDR color picker. |
| **Emission UV Mapping**         | Use the drop-down to select the type of UV mapping that HDRP uses for the **Emission Map**.<br /><br />Unity manages four UV channels for a vertex:**UV0**, **UV1**, **UV2**, and **UV3**.<br /><br />**Planar:** A planar projection from top to bottom.<br /><br />**Triplanar**: A planar projection in three directions:<br />X-axis: Left to right<br />Y-axis: Top to bottom<br />Z-axis: Front to back<br />Unity blends these three projections together to produce the final result. |
| **- Tiling**                    | Set an **X** and **Y** tile rate for the **Emission Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to tile the Texture assigned to the **Emission Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **- Offset**                    | Set an **X** and **Y** offset for the **Emission Map** UV. HDRP uses the **X** and **Y** values to offset the Texture assigned to the **Emission Map** across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| **Emission Intensity**          | Set the overall strength of the emission effect for this Material.Use the drop-down to select one of the following [physical light units](Physical-Light-Units.html) to use for intensity:<br /><br />[Luminance](Glossary.html#Luminance)<br /><br />[EV100](GLossary.html#EV) |
| **Exposure Weight**             | Use this slider to set how much effect the exposure has on the emission power. For example, if you create a neon tube, you would want to apply the emissive glow effect at every exposure. |
| **Emission Multiply with Base** | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP use the base color of the Material when it calculates the final color of the emission. When enabled, HDRP multiplies the emission color by the base color to calculate the final emission color. |
| **Emission**                    | Enable this checkbox to make the emission color affect global illumination. |
| **- Global Illumination**       | Use the drop-down to choose how color emission interacts with global illumination.<br /><br />**Realtime**: Select this option to make emission affect the result of real-time global illumination.<br /><br />**Baked**: Select this option to make emission only affect global illumination during the baking process.<br /><br />**None**: Select this option to make emission not affect global illumination. |

### Advanced options

| **Property**                            | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Enable GPU instancing**               | Enable this checkbox to tell HDRP to render meshes with the same geometry and Material/Shader in one batch when possible. This makes rendering faster. HDRP can not render Meshes in one batch if they have different Materials, or if the hardware does not support GPU instancing. For example, you can not static-batch GameObjects that have an animation based on the object pivot, but the GPU can instance them. |
| **Specular Occlusion from Bent normal** | Enable this checkbox to make HDRP use the Bent Normal Map to process specular occlusion for Reflection Probes. |
