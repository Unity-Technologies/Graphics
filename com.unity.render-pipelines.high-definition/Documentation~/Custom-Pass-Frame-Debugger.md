# Viewing a Custom Pass in the Frame Debugger

You can use the [Frame Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FrameDebugger.html) to examine every draw call you issued in the Custom Pass. To find your pass, look for the name you gave your Custom Pass in the Custom Pass Volume component.

In this example, the Custom Pass is called **My Outline Pass**. The **Frame Debug** window (menu:

**Window > Analysis > Frame Debugger**) displays the steps that **My Outline Pass** executes in the left window, highlighted in the image below:
