# Upgrading HDRP from 2021.1 to 2021.2

## Shader code

From 2021.2, if material ambient occlusion needs to be applied to probe volume GI and the material is deferred, the material needs to define `HAS_PAYLOAD_WITH_UNINIT_GI` constant and a function `float GetUninitializedGIPayload(SurfaceData surfaceData)` that returns the AO factor that is desired to be applied. No action is needed for forward only materials or if no material AO needs to be applied to probe volume GI.

HDRP 2021.2 includes the "ForwardEmissiveForDeferred" shader pass and the associated SHADERPASS_FORWARD_EMISSIVE_FOR_DEFERRED define for Materials that have a GBuffer pass. You can see the new pass in Lit.shader. When you use the Deferred Lit shader mode, Unity uses "ForwardEmissiveForDeferred" to render the emissive contribution of a Material in a separate forward pass. Otherwise, Unity ignores "ForwardEmissiveForDeferred".

From 2021.2, HDRP Decals can use a surface gradient based approach to perturb the normal of the affected objects. This feature needs to be enabled in the HDRP asset.
When creating a custom decal shader, the accumulated normal value stored in the DBuffer now represent the surface gradient instead of the tangent space normal. You can refer to `DecalUtilities.hlsl` for an example implementation.
When writing a shader for a surface receiving decals, the normals should now be blended using the surface gradient framework. The prototype for the function `ApplyDecalToSurfaceData` has changed from: `void ApplyDecalToSurfaceData(DecalSurfaceData decalSurfaceData, float3 vtxNormal, inout SurfaceData surfaceData)` to `void ApplyDecalToSurfaceData(DecalSurfaceData decalSurfaceData, float3 vtxNormal, inout SurfaceData surfaceData, inout float3 normalTS)`. You can refer to `LitData.hlsl` and `LitDecalData.hlsl` for an example implementation.
?### Tessellation
In HDRP 2021.2, HDRP refactored various tessellation shader code to enable support of tessellation in [Master Stacks](master-stack-hdrp.md).

* The function `GetTessellationFactors()` has moved from `LitDataMeshModification.hlsl` to `TessellationShare.hlsl`. It calls a new function, `GetTessellationFactor()`, that is in `LitDataMeshModification.hlsl`.
* The prototype of 'ApplyTessellationModification()' function has changed from:<br/> `void ApplyTessellationModification(VaryingsMeshToDS input, float3 normalWS, inout float3 positionRWS)`<br/>to:<br/>`VaryingsMeshToDS ApplyTessellationModification(VaryingsMeshToDS input, float3 timeParameters)`.
* HDRP has improved support of motion vectors for tessellation. Now only `previousPositionRWS` is part of the varyings and HDRP added the `MotionVectorTessellation()` function. For more information, see the `MotionVectorVertexShaderCommon.hlsl file.
* HDRP now evaluates the `tessellationFactor` in the vertex shader and passes it to the hull shader as an interpolator. For more information, see the `VaryingMesh.hlsl` and `VertMesh.hlsl` files.

## Density Volumes

Density Volumes are now known as **Local Volumetric Fog**. If a Scene uses Density Volumes, HDRP automatically migrates the GameObjects to use the new component name, with all the same properties set for the Density Volume. However, if you reference a **Density Volume** through a C# script, a warning appears (**DensityVolume has been deprecated (UnityUpgradable) -> Local Volumetric Fog**) in the Console window. To resolve this, change your code to target the new component. This warning may stop your Project from compiling in future versions of HDRP.

## ClearFlag

ClearFlag.Depth does not implicitely clear stencil anymore. ClearFlag.Stencil added.

## HDRP Global Settings

From 2021.2, the HDRP Asset assigned in the Graphics Settings no longer acts as the default Asset for HDRP. A new HDRP Global Settings Asset now exists to save settings unrelated to which HDRP Asset is active.

Also, to ensure your build will use up to date data, HDRenderPipelineAsset and HDRenderPipelineGlobalSettings can raise a build error if they are not up to date when building. They can only be upgraded in Editor. Just opening the editor will upgrade them if they are used in your project (in a QualitySettings or in GraphicsSettings). The error can be raised when building from command line.

## Materials

### Transparent Surface Type

From 2021.2, the range for **Sorting Priority** values has decreased from between -100 and 100 to between -50 and 50. If you used transparent materials (**Surface Type** set to **Transparent**) with a sorting priority lower than -50 or greater than 50, you must remap them to within the new range. HDRP does not clamp the Sorting Priority to the new range until you edit the Sorting Priority property.
