This is the documentation for the Scripting APIs of this package.

**Note**: The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is built on the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) and uses some class types that you can only find in the [SRP Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/index.html).
