# Requirements and compatibility

This page contains information on system requirements and compatibility of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) package.

## Unity Editor compatibility

The following table shows the compatibility of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) versions with different Unity Editor versions.

| **Package version** | **Minimum Unity version** | **Maximum Unity version** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 10.x                | 2020.2                    | 2020.2                    |

## Render pipeline compatibility

Projects made using HDRP are not compatible with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) or the Built-in Render Pipeline. Before you start development, you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project. For information on choosing a render pipeline, see the [Render Pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html) section of the Unity Manual.

## Unity Player system requirements

This section describes the HDRP packageâ€™s target platform requirements. For platforms or use cases not covered in this section, general system requirements for the Unity Player apply.

For more information, see [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html).

HRDP is only compatible with the following platforms:

- Windows and Windows Store, with DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 and Shader Model 5.0
- Modern consoles (Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One)
- MacOS (minimum version 10.13) using Metal graphics
- Linux and Windows platforms with Vulkan

**Note: HDRP only works on these platforms if the device used supports Compute Shaders. HDRP does not support OpenGL or OpenGL ES devices.**

### Ray tracing

To use ray tracing in HDRP, there are hardware requirements you must meet. For information on these requirements, see [Getting started with ray tracing](Ray-Tracing-Getting-Started.md#HardwareRequirements).
