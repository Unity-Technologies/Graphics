# Eye

The Eye Master Stack enables you to render custom physically-based eye materials in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). It models a two-layer material, in which the first layer describes the cornea and fluids on the surface, and the second layer describes the sclera and the iris, visible through the first layer. It supports various effects, such as cornea refraction, caustics, pupil dilation, limbal darkening, and subsurface scattering.

## Creating an Eye Shader Graph

To create an Eye material in Shader Graph, you can either:

* Modify an existing Shader Graph.
    1. Open the Shader Graph in the Shader Editor.
    2. In **Graph Settings**, select the **HDRP** Target. If there isn't one, go to **Active Targets,** click the **Plus** button, and select **HDRP**.
    3. In the **Material** drop-down, select **Eye**.

* Create a new Shader Graph.
    1. Go to **Assets > Create > Shader Graph > HDRP** and click **Eye Shader Graph**.

## Contexts

[!include[](snippets/master-stacks-contexts-intro.md)]

### Vertex Context

#### Default

When you create a new Eye Master Stack, the Vertex Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-position.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-normal.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-tangent.md)]
</table>

#### Relevant

This Master Stack material type adds all its Vertex Blocks to the Vertex Context by default and has no extra relevant Blocks.

### Fragment Context

#### Default

When you create a new Eye Master Stack, the Fragment Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>

#### Relevant

Depending on the [Graph Settings](#graph-settings) you use, Shader Graph can add the following Blocks to the Fragment Context:
