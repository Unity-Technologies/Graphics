# Upgrading HDRP from Unity 2020.1 to Unity 2020.2

In the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), some features work differently between major versions of Unity. This document helps you upgrade HDRP from Unity 2020.1 to 2020.2.

## Constant Buffer API

From Unity 2020.2, HDRP uses a new constant buffer API that allows it to set up uniforms during the frame and send them to the shader in a single transfer instead of multiple transfers. To do this, the global variables that were declared individually are now all within the `ShaderVariablesGlobal ` struct. The consequence of this is that its no longer possible to setup any of the global values individually using `CommandBuffer.SetVectorXXX()` or its related functions. Instead, to change a global variable, you need to update the struct in its entirety.

Currently, the only publicly accessible variables in the `ShaderVariablesGlobal` struct are camera related and only available within [Custom Passes](Custom-Pass.md) via the following functions:

* `RenderFromCamera()`
* `RenderDepthFromCamera()`
* `RenderNormalFromCamera()`
* `RenderTangentFromCamera()`


## Frame Settings

From Unity 2020.2, if you create a new [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md), the **MSAA Within Forward** Frame Setting is enabled by default.

## Decal

From Unity 2020.2, decals no longer require a full Depth Prepass. HDRP only renders Materials with **Receive Decals** enabled during the Depth Prepass. Unless other options force it.

From Unity 2020.2, you can use the Decal Layers system which makes use of the **Rendering Layer Mask** property from a Mesh Renderer and Terrain. The default value of this property prior to 2020.2 does not include any Decal Layer flags. This means that when you enable this feature, no Meshes receive decals until you configure them correctly. A script **Edit > Render Pipeline/HD Render Pipeline > Upgrade from Previous Version > Add Decal Layer Default to Loaded Mesh Renderers and Terrains** is provided to convert the already created Meshes, as well a version to apply only on a selection. Newly created Mesh Renderer or Terrain have the have **Decal Layer Default** enable by default.

## Lighting

From Unity 2020.2, if you disable the sky override used as the **Static Lighting Sky** in the **Lighting** window, the sky no longer affects the baked lighting. Previously, the sky affected the baked lighting even when it was disabled.

From Unity 2020.2, HDRP has 
the Cubemap Array for Point [Light](Light-Component.md) cookies and now uses octahedral projection with a regular 2D-Cookie atlas. This is to allow for a single path for light cookies and IES, but it may produce visual artifacts when using a low-resolution cube-cookie. For example, projecting pixel art data.

As the **Cubemap cookie atlas** no longer exists, it is possible that HDRP does not have enough space on the current 2D atlas for the cookies. If this is the case, HDRP displays an error in the Console window. To fix this, increase the size of the 2D cookie atlas. To do this:
Select your [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md).
In the Inspector, go to Lighting > Cookies.
In the 2D Atlas Size drop-down, select a larger cookie resolution.

From Unity 2020.2, the texture format of the color buffer in the HDRP Asset also applies to [Planar Reflection Probes](Planar-Reflection-Probe.md). Previously, Planar Reflection Probes always used a float16 rendertarget.

From Unity 2020.2, the light layer properties have move from the HDRP settings to the HDRP Default setting Panel.

From Unity 2020.2, in physically based sky, the sun disk intensity is proportional to its size. Before this the sun disk was incorrectly not drive by the sun disk size.

From Unity 2020.2, if you previously used the **UseEmissiveIntensity** property in either a Decal, Lit, LayeredLit, or Unlit Material, be aware that the **EmissiveColorLDR** property is in sRGB color space. Previously HDRP handled **EmissiveColor** as being in linear RGB color space so there may be a mismatch in visuals between versions. To fix this mismatch, HDRP includes a migration script that handles the conversion automatically.

For project migrating from old 9.x.x-preview package. There is a change in the order of enum of Exposure that may shift the current exposure mode to another one in Exposure Volume. This will need to be corrected manually by reselecting the correct Exposure mode.

## Shadows

From Unity 2020.2, it is no longer necessary to change the [HDRP Config package](HDRP-Config-Package.md) to set the [shadow filtering quality](HDRP-Asset.md#FilteringQualities) for deferred rendering. Instead, you can now change the filtering quality directly on the [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md#FilteringQualities). Note if you previously had not set the shadow filtering quality to **Medium** on the HDRP Asset, the automatic project upgrade process changes the shadow quality which means you may need to manually change it back to its original value.

HDRP now stores OnEnable and OnDemand shadows in a separate atlas and more API is available to handle them. For more information, see [Shadows in HDRP](Shadows-in-HDRP.md).

The shader function `SampleShadow_PCSS` now requires you to pass in an additional float2 parameter which contains the shadow atlas resolution in x and the inverse of the atlas resolution in y.

Ray bias and thickness parameters have been added to contact shadows. These might lead to small changes to the visual impact of contact shadows with the default parameters. Please consider tuning those values to fit the needs of your project.

## Shader config file

From Unity 2020.2, due to the change of the shadow map, HDRP moved the HDShadowFilteringQuality enum to HDShadowManager.cs. HDRP also removed ShaderConfig.s_DeferredShadowFiltering and ShaderOptions.DeferredShadowFiltering from the source code because they have no effect anymore.

From Unity 2020.2, a new option is available named ColoredShadow. It allows you to control whether a shadow is chromatic or monochrome. ColoredShadow is enabled by default and currently only works with [Ray-traced shadows](Ray-Traced-Shadows.md). Note that colored shadows are more resource-intensive to process than standard shadows.

From Unity 2020.2, the Raytracing option and equivalent generated shader macro SHADEROPTIONS_RAYTRACING have been removed. You no longer need to edit the shader config file to use ray-traced effects in HDRP.

## Shader code

From Unity 2020.2, HDRP uses a new structure to output information from the LightLoop. It now uses a custom LightLoop struct instead of the `float3 diffuseLighting`, `float3 specularLighting` pair. This is to allow HDRP to export more information from the LightLoop in the future without breaking the API.

The following functions now pass this structure instead of the pair:

* LightLoop(), for both rasterization and raytracing.
* PostEvaluateBSDF()
* ApplyDebug()
* PostEvaluateBSDFDebugDisplay()

To upgrade an existing shader, for all the above functions:

1. Replace the declaration `float3 diffuseLighting; float3 specularLighting;` with `LightLoopOutput lightLoopOutput;` before the LightLoop call.
2. Replace the argument pair `out float3 diffuseLighting, out float3 specularLighting` with `out LightLoopOutput lightLoopOutput`.



The prototype for the function `ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting()` in the various materials has changed from:
`void ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting(float3 V, PositionInputs posInput, SurfaceData surfaceData, inout BuiltinData builtinData)`
to:
 `void ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting(float3 V, PositionInputs posInput, PreLightData preLightData, BSDFData bsdfData, inout BuiltinData builtinData)`

There is also a new definition for `ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting()` that uses the former prototype definition and calls the new function prototype with the correct arguments. The purpose of this change it to prepare for future lighting features. To update your custom shaders, in addition of the prototype update, you must remove the following lines:
```
BSDFData bsdfData = ConvertSurfaceDataToBSDFData(posInput.positionSS, surfaceData);

PreLightData preLightData = GetPreLightData(V, posInput, bsdfData);
```

From Unity 2020.2, HDRP includes a new rectangular area shadow evaluation function, EvaluateShadow_RectArea. The GetAreaLightAttenuation() function has been renamed to GetRectAreaShadowAttenuation(). Also the type DirectionalShadowType have been renamed SHADOW_TYPE.

From Unity 2020.2, the macro ENABLE_RAYTRACING, SHADEROPTIONS_RAYTRACING, and RAYTRACING_ENABLED have been removed. A new multicompile is introduce for forward pass: SCREEN_SPACE_SHADOWS_OFF SCREEN_SPACE_SHADOWS_ON. This allow to enable raytracing effect without requiring edition of shader config file.

From Unity 2020.2,SHADERPASS for TransparentDepthPrepass and TransparentDepthPostpass identification is using respectively SHADERPASS_TRANSPARENT_DEPTH_PREPASS and SHADERPASS_TRANSPARENT_DEPTH_POSTPASS. Previously it was SHADERPASS_DEPTH_ONLY. Define CUTOFF_TRANSPARENT_DEPTH_PREPASS and CUTOFF_TRANSPARENT_DEPTH_POSTPASS and been removed as the new path macro can now be used.

Unity 2020.2 introduces a new multi-compile for Depth Prepass and Motion vector pass to allow for support of the Decal Layers feature. These passes now require you to add #pragma multi_compile _ WRITE_DECAL_BUFFER.

From Unity 2020.2, the shader code for the Decal.shader has changed. Previously, the code used around 16 passes to handle the rendering of different decal attributes. It now only uses four passes: DBufferProjector, DecalProjectorForwardEmissive, DBufferMesh, DecalMeshForwardEmissive. Some pass names are also different. DBufferProjector and DBufferMesh now use a multi_compile DECALS_3RT DECALS_4RT to handle the differents variants and the shader stripper has been updated as well. Various Shader Decal Properties have been renamed/changed to match a new set of AffectXXX properties (_AlbedoMode, _MaskBlendMode, _MaskmapMetal, _MaskmapAO, _MaskmapSmoothness, _Emissive have been changed to _AffectAlbedo, _AffectNormal, _AffectAO, _AffectMetal, _AffectSmoothness, _AffectEmission - Keyword _ALBEDOCONTRIBUTION is now _MATERIAL_AFFECTS_ALBEDO and two new keywords, _MATERIAL_AFFECTS_NORMAL, _MATERIAL_AFFECTS_MASKMAP, have been added). These new properties now match with properties from the Decal Shader Graph which are now exposed in the Material. A Material upgrade process automatically upgrades all the Decal Materials. However, if your project includes any C# scripts that create or manipulate a Decal Material, you need to update the scripts to use the new properties and keyword; the migration does not work on procedurally generated Decal Materials.
## Custom pass API

The signature of the Execute function has changed to simplify the parameters, now it only takes a CustomPassContext as its input:
`void Execute(CustomPassContext ctx)`

The CustomPassContext contains all the parameters of the old `Execute` function, but also all the available Render Textures as well as a MaterialPropertyBlock unique to the custom pass instance.

This context allows you to use the new [CustomPassUtils]( ../api/UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition.CustomPassUtils.md) class which contains functions to speed up the development of your custom passes.

For information on custom pass utilities, see the [custom pass manual](Custom-Pass-API-User-Manual.md) or the [CustomPassUtils API documentation](../api/UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition.CustomPassUtils.md).

To upgrade your custom pass, replace the original execute function prototype with the new one. To do this, replace:

```
protected override void Execute(ScriptableRenderContext renderContext, CommandBuffer cmd, HDCamera hdCamera, CullingResults cullingResult) { ... }
```

With:

```
protected override void Execute(CustomPassContext ctx) { ... }
```
