## [Unreleased]
### Added


### Changed


## [0.1.6] - 2018-xx-yy

### New features and functionality
- Added Screen Space Reflection with Proxy Projection Model

### Bug fixes
- Fix fog flags in scene view is now taken into account
- Fix sky in preview windows that were disappearing after a load of a new level
- Fix numerical issues in IntersectRayAABB().
- Fix alpha blending of volumetric lighting with transparent objects.
- Fix the near plane of the V-Buffer causing out-of-bounds look-ups in the clustered data structure.
- Depth and color pyramid are properly computed and sampled when the camera renders inside a viewport of a RTHandle.

### Changed, Removals and deprecations
- EnableShadowMask in FrameSettings (But shadowMaskSupport still disable by default)
- Forced Planar Probe update modes to (Realtime, Every Update, Mirror Camera)
- Removed Planar Probe mirror plane position and normal fields in inspector, always display mirror plane and normal gizmos
- Screen Space Refraction proxy model uses the proxy of the first environment light (Reflection probe/Planar probe) or the sky
- Moved RTHandle static methods to RTHandles
- Renamed RTHandle to RTHandleSystem.RTHandle
 
### Improvements
- Port Global Density Volumes to the Interpolation Volume System.
- Optimize ImportanceSampleLambert() to not require the tangent frame.
- Generalize SampleVBuffer() to handle different sampling and reconstruction methods.
- Improve the quality of volumetric lighting reprojection.
- Optimize Morton Order code in the Subsurface Scattering pass.
- Planar Reflection Probe support roughness (gaussian convolution of captured probe)
- Only store decal textures to atlas if decal is visible, debounce out of memory decal atlas warning.

### Features
- Screen Space Refraction projection model (Proxy raycasting, HiZ raymarching)
- Screen Space Refraction settings as volume component
- Added buffered frame history per camera
