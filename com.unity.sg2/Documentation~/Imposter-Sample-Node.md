# Imposter Sample Node

## Description

Uses the UV coordinates generated by the Imposter UV node to sample an specific imposter texture. 
This creates the illusion of a 3D object on a billboard object because the imposter texture's frame changes based on the camera direction and angle.
If the imposter object has more than one texture to sample (e.g. color, normal, mask, occlusion, etc,), multiple Imposter Sample nodes can be used.
## Ports

| Name        | Direction           | Type  | Description |
|:------------ |:-------------|:-----|:---|
| Texture | Input      |    Texture2D | The texture asset to sample |
| Sampler | Input      |    Sampler State | The texture sampler to use for sampling the texture |
| UV0 | Input      |    Vector2 | The virtual UV for the base frame |
| UV1 | Input      |    Vector2 | The virtual UV for the second frame |
| UV2 | Input      |    Vector2 | The virtual UV for the third frame |
| Grid | Input      |    Vector4 | The current UV grid, which is used to find the corresponding sample frames |
| Weights | Input      |    Vector4 | The blending values in between the slected three frames|
| RGBA | Output      |    Vector4 | A vector4 from the sampled texture |

## Generated code example

[!include[nodes-generated-code](./snippets/nodes-generated-code.md)], based on the selected Mode on the Imposter Sample Node node:

### ThreeFrames

```
ImposterSample( Texture.tex, TexelSize, Weights, Grid, UV0, UV1, UV2, Sampler.samplerstate, RGBA);
```

### OneFrame

```
ImposterSample_oneFrame( Texture.tex, TexelSize, Weights, Grid, UV0, UV1, UV2, Sampler.samplerstate, RGBA);
```
