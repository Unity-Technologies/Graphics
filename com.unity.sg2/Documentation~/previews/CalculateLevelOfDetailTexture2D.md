## Description
Computes LOD values for use with texture sample nodes.

## Inputs
**Texture** - The texture asset from which to calculate LODs.
**UV** - The texture coordinates to use for the texture.
**Sampler** - The texture sampler to use for the texture.

## Output
**LOD** - The calculated level of detail.

## Controls
**Clamp** - Clamps the output to the mips on the input Texture or an ideal mip level for a texture with all mips present.
