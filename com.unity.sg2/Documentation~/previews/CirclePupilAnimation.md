## Description
Applies a deformation to a normalized Iris UV to simulate the opening and closing of the pupil.

## Input
**Iris UV** - Normalized UV coordinates that can be used to sample an iris texture.
**"Pupil Radius** -Radius of the pupil in the iris texture as a percentage.
**Pupil Aperture** - The current size of the pupil aperature.
**Min Pupil Aperture** - The minimum size of the pupil aperture.
**Max Pupil Aperture** -The maximum size of the pupil aperture.

## Output
**Animated Iris UV** - Normalized iris UV coordinates with animation for pupil expansion/contraction.
