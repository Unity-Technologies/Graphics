## Description
Uses the UV coordinates generated by the Imposter UV node to sample an specific imposter texture. 
This creates the illusion of a 3D object on a billboard object because the imposter texture's frame changes based on the camera direction and angle.

## Inputs
**Texture** - The texture asset to sample.
**Sampler** - The texture sampler to use for sampling the texture.
**UV0** - The virtual UV for the base frame.
**UV1** - The virtual UV for the second frame.
**UV2** - The virtual UV for the third frame.
**Grid** - The current UV grid, which is used to find the corresponding sample frames.
**Weights** - The blending values in between the slected three frames.

## Output
**RGBA** - A vector4 from the sampled texture.
**RGB** - A vector3 from the sampled texture.
**R** - The r channel of the sampled texture.
**G** - The g channel of the sampled texture.
**B** - The b channel of the sampled texture.
**A** - The a channel of the sampled texture.

## Controls
**Sample Type** - Select whether to sample three frames or one frame, three frames for smoother result, one frame for better performance.
