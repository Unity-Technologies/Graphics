## Description
Calculates the hyperbolic tangent of each component of the input.

## Inputs
**In** - Input value.

## Output
**Out** - The hyperbolic tangent of each component of the input.

## Controls
**Mode** - Because the trigonometry functions are some of the most expensive functions to calculate, Shader Graph provides approximations accessed by selecting the Fast mode. These are generally about twice as fast to calculate, but please note that Fast mode is only accurate with input values between -1 and 1.
