# Color Modes

## Description

Shader Graph can display colors on nodes in your graph to improve readability. This feature uses **Color Modes** to change which colors to display in the graph. Use the **Color Mode:** drop-down menu in the top right corner of the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window.md) to change the **Color Modes**.

## Modes

| Name         | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| None         | Does not display colors on the nodes. All nodes use the default gray. |
| Category     | Displays colors on the nodes based on their assigned category. See **Category Colors** below. |
| Heatmap      | Displays colors on the nodes based on the nodes relative performance cost. By default, dark colored nodes contribute very little to the overall GPU performance cost of the shader and brighter colored nodes require more GPU computation to run. |
| Precision    | Displays colors on the nodes based on the current [Precision Mode](Precision-Modes) in use. |
| User Defined | Lets you set the display colors on a per-node basis. These are custom colors for your graph. See **User Defined Colors** below. |

### Category Colors

This mode displays colors on the nodes based on their category. See the [Node Library](Node-Library.md) to learn about the different categories available.

Artistic nodes appear in orange, #DB773B, channel-related nodes in green, #97D13D, input nodes in red, #CB3022, math operations in blue, #4B92F3, procedural elements in purple, #9C4FFF, utility nodes in gray, #AEAEAE, and UV-related nodes in teal, #08D78B.](images/Color-Mode-Category.png)

The table below lists current categories and their corresponding colors.

| Name       | Color Hex Value |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| Artistic   | #DB773B         |
| Channel    | #97D13D         |
| Input      | #CB3022         |
| Math       | #4B92F3         |
| Procedural | #9C4FFF         |
| Utility    | #AEAEAE         |
| UV         | #08D78B         |

**Note:** [Sub Graph](Sub-Graph.md) nodes in a main [Shader Graph](index.md) fall in the Utility category. If you select **Category** mode, all Sub Graphs use the Utility color.

### Precision Colors

This mode displays colors on the nodes based on their current precision. If you set a node to **Inherit Precision**, the display color reflects the currently active precision. See [Precision Modes](Precision-Modes.md) for more information about inheritance.

### User Defined Colors

This mode displays colors on the nodes based on user preferences. In this mode, the user defines colors for each node. If a custom color is not set, the node displays in the default gray.

To set a custom color for a node, right-click on the target node to bring up the the context menu, and select **Color**.

| Option    | Description |
|:-------   |:------------|
| Change... |Brings up a color picker menu and lets you set your own custom color on the node. |
| Reset     | Removes the currently selected color and sets it to the default gray. |


## Overriding Default Colors

For each project, you can override preset colors in the **Category** and **Precision** modes. Unity uses a `.uss` style sheet and Hex color codes to set colors. The default style sheet in your project is  `Packages/com.unity.shadergraph/Editor/Resources/Styles/ColorMode.uss`.

The best practice is to create a copy of this file to override the presets. Under your project's **Assets** folder, create a new `Editor/Resources/Styles` folder structure, and place a copy of `ColorMode.uss` in the `Styles` folder. Change the Hex color codes in this `.uss` file to override the presets and use your own custom colors for the **Category** and **Precision** modes.
