# Add a Sub Graph to a shader graph

To add a [Sub Graph](Sub-graph.md) to a shader graph, use one of the following approaches:

- Drag the Sub Graph asset from the Project window into the Shader Graph window.
- In the Shader Graph window, right-click to open the context menu, then select **Create Node** > **Sub Graph** and the name of your Sub Graph.

Unity adds a Sub Graph node to the shader graph. For more information, refer to [Sub Graph Node](Sub-graph-Node.md).

## Change the location in the Create Node menu

To change the location of the Sub Graph in the **Create Node** menu, follow these steps:

1. Open the Sub Graph asset.
2. In the blackboard, select the gray **Sub Graphs** label.
3. Type the name of another folder from the **Create Node** menu, for example **Artistic**.
