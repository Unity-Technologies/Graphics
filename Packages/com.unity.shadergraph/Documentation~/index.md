# Shader Graph

Shader Graph enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of writing code, you create and connect nodes in a graph framework. Shader Graph gives instant feedback that reflects your changes, and it’s simple enough for users who are new to shader creation.

Shader Graph is automatically available in your project as soon as you install the [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html) or the [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest). Refer to [Shader Graph installation details](install-shader-graph.md).
