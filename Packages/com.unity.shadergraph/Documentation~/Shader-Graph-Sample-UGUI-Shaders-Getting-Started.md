# Getting Started
After you import the sample from the Package Manager open this scene:

 - `Assets\Samples\Shader Graph\<version number>\UGUI Shaders\Scenes\UISampleScene.unity`

Here you can see some sample buttons, indicators, and backgrounds. All of these UI elements were constructed in Shader Graph using the subgraphs in this sample.

To see the subgraphs in a gallery, open this Shader Graph file:
 - `Assets/Samples/Shader Graph/<version number>/UGUI Shaders/Subgraphs/SubgraphLibrary.shadergraph`

Here you’ll see all of the subgraphs grouped according to the category they’re in.  You can double-click any of them to jump into the subgraph to see what it does.
You can also right click in any Shader Graph shader and find the subgraphs in the UI category in the Add Node window.

To see examples of how to use the subgraphs, open the following Shader Graph asset:
 - `Assets/Samples/Shader Graph/17.0.3/UGUI Shaders/Examples/SimpleExamples.shadergraph`

This file contains several simple examples that show how the UI subgraphs can be used together to create interesting effects. It’s a good demonstration of the functionality of the subgraph nodes.

To see examples of how to create UI buttons and indicators, open this Shader Graph file:
 - `Assets/Samples/Shader Graph/17.0.3/UGUI Shaders/Examples/ButtonsAndIndicators.shadergraph`

This file contains several example buttons and indicators. You can double click on any of them to open the Shader Graph assets and see how they’re constructed.
