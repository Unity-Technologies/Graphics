# Getting started with Shader Graph

Use Shader Graph with either of the Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRPs) available in Unity version 2018.1 and later:

- The [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest)
- The [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html)

As of Unity version 2021.2, you can also use Shader Graph with the [Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html).

> [!NOTE]
> Shader Graph support for the Built-In Render Pipeline is for compatibility purposes only. Shader Graph doesn't receive updates for Built-In Render Pipeline support, aside from bug fixes for existing features. It's recommended to use Shader Graph with the Scriptable Render Pipelines.

## Installation

When you install HDRP or URP into your project, Unity also installs the Shader Graph package automatically. You can manually install Shader Graph for use with the Built-In Render Pipeline on Unity version 2021.2 and later with the Package Manager. For more information on how to install a package, see [Adding and removing packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-actions.html) in the Unity User Manual.

For more information about how to set up a Scriptable Render Pipeline, see [Getting started with HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/getting-started-in-hdrp.html) or [Getting started with URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/InstallingAndConfiguringURP).
