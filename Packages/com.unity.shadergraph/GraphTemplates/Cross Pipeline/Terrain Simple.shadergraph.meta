    description: 'A simple Shader Graph terrain shader that only supports color textures.
      It does not support normal, smoothness, ambient occlusion, etc. But it is also
      very cheap to render. With this template, you can extend or simplify the functionality
      of the terrain shader to suit the needs of your project including adding or
      removing layers. This version currently supports 4 layers.

      

      

      For
      more ideas and examples of how to work with terrain shaders, import the Terrain
      Shaders sample from the Shader Graph package in the Package Manager.
