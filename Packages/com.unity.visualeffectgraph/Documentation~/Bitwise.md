# Bitwise Operators

Perform bitwise logical operations on inputs.

| **Page** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [And](Operator-BitwiseAnd.md) | Perform a bitwise AND operation, which outputs 1 if both bits are 1. |
| [Complement](Operator-BitwiseComplement.md) | Perform a bitwise NOT operation to invert each bit. |
| [Left Shift](Operator-BitwiseLeftShift.md) | Shift an input value left by a specified number of bits. |
| [Or](Operator-BitwiseOr.md) | Perform a bitwise OR operation, which outputs 1 if either bit is 1. |
| [Right Shift](Operator-BitwiseRightShift.md) | Shift an input value right by a specified number of bits. |
| [Xor](Operator-BitwiseXor.md) | Perform a bitwise XOR operation, which outputs 1 if only one bit is 1. |
