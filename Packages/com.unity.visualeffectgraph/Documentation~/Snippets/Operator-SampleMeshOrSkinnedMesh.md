## Operator settings

| **Property**            | **Type** | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Output**              | Enum     | **(Inspector)** Select the vertex attributes to read from the vertex. |
| **Mode**                | Enum     | The wrap mode to use for the sequence. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Clamp**: Clamps the index between the first and last vertices.<br/>&#8226; **Wrap**: Wraps the index around to the other side of the vertex list. <br/>&#8226; **Mirror**: Mirrors the vertex list so out of range indices move back and forth through the list. |
| **Placement mode**      | Enum     | Specify which primitive part of the mesh to sample from:<br/>&#8226; **Vertex**: Samples positions from all listed vertices.<br/>&#8226; **Edge**: Samples from an interpolation between two consecutives vertices that are part of a triangle on the mesh. <br/>&#8226; **Surface**: Samples from an interpolation between three vertices that define a triangle on the mesh. |
| **Surface coordinates** | Enum     | Specify the method this Block uses to sample the surface of a triangle.<br/>&#8226; **Barycentric**: Samples the surface using raw barycentric coordinates. With this method, sampled positions are not constrained by the triangle edges which is useful if you have baked a position outside of the Visual Effect Graph.<br/>&#8226; **Uniform**: Samples the surface uniformly within the triangle area.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Surface** and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Skinned Transform**     | Enum     | Specify the transform to apply to the sample from the Skinned Mesh Renderer.<br />&#8226; **None**: Apply no transform. The sample is the raw value from the geometry buffer of the Skinned Mesh Renderer.<br/>&#8226; **Apply Local Root Transform**: Apply the transform of the root bone relative to the Skinned Mesh Renderer.<br/>&#8226; **Apply World Root Transform**: Apply the world transform of the root bone. <br/>This property only appears if you set **Source** to **Skinned Mesh Renderer**. |
| **Source**              | Enum     | **(Inspector)** Specify the kind of geometry to sample from. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Mesh**: Samples from a mesh asset. The Operator becomes a [Sample Mesh](./Operator-SampleMesh.md) Operator. <br/>&#8226; **Skinned Mesh Renderer**: Samples from a [Skinned Mesh Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SkinnedMeshRenderer.html). The Operator becomes a [Sample Skinned Mesh](./Operator-SampleSkinnedMesh.md) Operator.|

### Operator properties

| **Input**                 | **Type**              | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mesh**                  | Mesh                  | The source mesh asset to sample.<br/><br/>This property only appears if you set **Source** to **Mesh** |
| **Skinned Mesh Renderer** | Skinned Mesh Renderer | The source Skinned Mesh Renderer component to sample. This is a reference to a component within the scene. To assign a Skinned Mesh Renderer to this port, create a Skinned Mesh Renderer property in the [Blackboard](Blackboard.md) and expose it.<br/><br/>This property only appears if you set **Source** to **Skinned Mesh Renderer**. |
| **Vertex**                | uint                  | The index of the vertex to sample.<br/><br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Vertex**. |
| **Index**                 | uint                  | The start index of the edge to sample from. The Block uses this index and the following index to select the line to sample from.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Edge** and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Triangle**              | uint                  | The index of triangle to sample, assuming the index buffer contains a triangle list.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Surface**, **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**, and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Edge**                  | float                 | The interpolation value the Block uses to sample along the edge. This is the percentage along the edge, from start position to end position, that the sample position is taken.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Edge** and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Barycentric**           | Vector2               | The raw barycentric coordinate to sample from the triangle at. The input is two-dimensional (**X** and **Y**) and the block calculates the **Z** value with the values you input: **Z** = **1** - **X** - **Y**. This sampling method does not constrain the sampled position inside the triangle edges.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Surface**, **Surface coordinates** to **Barycentric**, and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Square**                | Vector2               | The uniform coordinate to sample the triangle at. The Block takes this value and maps it from a square coordinate to triangle space. To do this, it uses the method outlined in the paper [A Low-Distortion Map Between Triangle and Square](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02073696v2) (Heitz 2019).<br/>This property only appears if you set **Placement mode** to **Surface**, **Surface coordinates** to **Uniform**, and **Spawn Mode** to **Custom**. |
| **Transform**             | Transform             | The transform to apply after sampling. If you set **Source** to **Skinned Mesh Renderer** and **Skinned Transform** to a setting other than **None**, Visual Effect Graph applies the transform after the root bone transform. If you set **Skinned Transform** to **Apply World Root Transform**, the Visual Effect Graph converts the transform to world space. |

| **Output**             | **Type**  | **Description**                                              |

To make this value more accurate, Visual Effect Graph considers the root transform of the previous frame.

This property only appears if you select **Previous Normal** in **Output**. |
| **Previous Tangent**   | Vector    | The x, y, and z components of the tangent of the vertex from the previous frame.

This property only appears if you select **Previous Tangent** in **Output**. |
| **Previous Bitangent** | Vector    | The cross product of **Normal** and **Tangent**, multiplied by **Bitangent Sign**, from the previous frame. You must enable [SkinnedMeshRenderer.skinnedMotionVectors](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer-skinnedMotionVectors.html) or Visual Effect Graph falls back to the current frame.

Visual Effect Graph calculates **Transform** using **Previous Normal**, **Previous Tangent** and **Previous Position**. This property only appears if you select **Transform** in **Output**. |

#### Limitations

The Mesh sampling feature has the following limitations:

- It only supports [VertexAttributeFormat.Float32](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.Float32.html) for all [VertexAttributes](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttribute.html) except [Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttribute.Color.html), which has to be a four component attribute using either [VertexAttributeFormat.UInt8](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.UInt8.html) or [VertexAttributeFormat.Float32](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.Float32.html) format.
- If the mesh isn't [readable](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh-isReadable.html), the Operator returns 0. For information on how to make a mesh readable in the Editor, refer to the [Import Settings for a model file](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html).
- Visual Effect Graph can't sample the current Skinned Mesh Renderer if you disable **Update When Offscreen** in a [Skinned Mesh Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SkinnedMeshRenderer.html) and the mesh bounds aren't visible. Visual Effect Graph uses the position, normal and tangent of the last visible frame.
