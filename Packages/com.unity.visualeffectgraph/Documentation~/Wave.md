| [Sine Wave](Operator-SineWave.md) | Generate a waveform that smoothly oscillates between two values. |
| [Square Wave](Operator-SquareWave.md) | Generate a value that alternates between two values. |
| [Triangle Wave](Operator-TriangleWave.md) | Generate a value that oscillates between two values. |
