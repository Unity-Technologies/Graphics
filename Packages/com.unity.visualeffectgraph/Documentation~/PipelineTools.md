# Pipeline tools

Explore tools and techniques for working with complex shapes and custom behaviors.

| **Page** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Representing Complex Shapes](representing-complex-shapes.md) | Use Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) and Point Caches to create complex shapes. |
| [ExposedProperty Helper](ExposedPropertyHelper.md) | Store and access properties in shaders. |
| [Vector Fields](VectorFields.md) | Use 3D shapes as 3D textures to control the behavior of particles. |
| [Spawner Callbacks](SpawnerCallbacks.md) | Use a C# API to control spawning, and access the spawn count and spawn events. |
