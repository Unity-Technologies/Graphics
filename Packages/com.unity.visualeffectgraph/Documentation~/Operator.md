# Operators

Calculate, convert, and manipulate data for particles and effects.

| **Page** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Attribute Operators](OperatorAttribute.md) | Get the data from particle attributes. |
| [Bitwise Operators](Bitwise.md) | Perform bitwise logical operations on inputs. |
| [Built-in Operators](Builtin.md) | Get time, frame indices, camera data, and coordinates. |
| [Camera Operators](Camera.md) | Convert positions between view space and world space. |
| [Color Operators](Color.md) | Output and convert color values. |
| [Custom HLSL Operator](Operator-CustomHLSL.md) | Write an HLSL function that takes inputs and produces outputs. |
| [Inline Operators](Inline.md) | Store values, vectors, shapes, and textures. |
| [Logic Operators](Logic.md) | Perform Boolean operations and conditional branching. |
| [Math](Math.md) | Perform mathematical calculations on input data. |
| [Noise Operators](Noise.md) | Generate procedural noise patterns, for example to control the behavior of particles over time. |
| [Random Operators](Random.md) | Generate random values or select random outputs. |
| [Sampling Operators](Sampling.md) | Fetch data from buffers, meshes, and textures. |
| [Spawn State](Operator-SpawnState.md) | Get information such as the number of particles spawned in the current frame, and the duration of the spawn loop. |
