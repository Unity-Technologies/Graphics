## Custom HLSL Nodes (block and operator)

These Custom HLSL nodes let you execute custom HLSL code during particle simulation.
You can use an [operator](Operator-CustomHLSL.md) for horizontal flow or a [block](Block-CustomHLSL.md) for vertical flow (in contexts).

## Node settings

| **Setting name**       | UI         | Location   | Action                         |
|------------------------|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Name**               | Text field | Inspector  | Choose the name of the block   |
| **HLSL Code**          | Button     | Graph node | Opens a code editor window     |
| **Available Function** | Drop down  | Graph node | Pick which function to execute |


## HLSL Code
The HLSL code can be either **embedded** in the node or an **HLSL file** can be used.
You can provide multiple functions in the same HLSL source (embedded or file), in this case, you'll have to pick the desired one in a choice list in the node.    
To be valid and correctly interpreted by the VFX Graph, some conventions must be adopted.

## Function declaration
To be properly recognized by VFX Graph the function must fulfill the following requirements:
- Return a supported type [Supported types](#Supported-types)
- Each function parameter must be of a [Supported types](#Supported-types)
- If you declare multiple functions, they must have unique names.

## Inline documentation
You can specify a tooltip for each function parameter using the three slash comment notation as shown below:
```csharp
/// <parameter-name>: the tooltip's text
```

These comments must be right above the function declaration.
```csharp
/// a: the tooltip for parameter a
/// b: the tooltip for parameter b
float Distance(in float3 a, in float3 b)
{
  return distance(a, b);
}
```

You may want to write a helper function that you don't want to be exposed in the node's choice list.    
In that case, simply put this special comment above the function declaration:
```csharp
/// Hidden
float SomeFunction(in float a)
{
  ...
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you need to implement helper functions, you must use a HLSL file, not the embedded HLSL code.

## Sampling

### Textures
The simplest way to sample a texture is to use the VFX Graph structure called VFXSampler2D (or VFXSample3D) which is defined as shown below:
```csharp
struct VFXSampler2D
{
    Texture2D t;
    SamplerState s;
};
```
VFX Graph provides this function: `float4 SampleTexture(VFXSampler2D texure, float2 coordinates)`.    
But you can also use HLSL built-in functions to sample a texture using the VFXSampler2D fields.    
In that case, since this is used in a compute shader you must specify which mipmap level to sample (use `SampleLevel` for instance).

### Buffers
You can use two types of buffers: `ByteAddressBuffer` and  `StructuredBuffer<>`.
In both cases the usage is the same as in any HLSL code:
- `ByteAddressBuffer`: use the `Load` function
```csharp
uint char = buffer.Load(attributes.particleId % count);
```
- `StructuredBuffer<>`: use classic index accessor
```csharp
float angle = phase + freq * buffer[attributes.particleId % bufferSize];
```

### Gradient
Gradients are handled specifically in VFX Graph (they are packed in a single texture) so you must use a dedicated function to sample them.    
Here is the function definition: `SampleGradient(VFXGradient gradient, float t)`
```csharp
float3 color = SampleGradient(grad, t);
```

### Curve
Sampling a curve is really similar to sampling a gradient.    
Here is the function definition: `SampleCurve(VFXCurve curve, float t)`
```csharp
float r = SampleCurve(curve, t);
```

## HLSL Code Editor
You can edit your HLSL code directly inside Unity Editor by clicking the `Edit` button on the node in the graph (see screenshot [above](#custom-hlsl-nodes-block-and-operator)).    
The HLSL Code Editor supports the following shortcuts:
- `Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Y` for Undo/Redo (independent from the Unity Editor undo stack)
- `Ctrl + S` to save the current HLSL code
- `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel` to change the font size

>If you need to write down the name of a particle attribute, you can drag and drop the attribute from the blackboard to the code editor.  This way you avoid any risk of typo.
