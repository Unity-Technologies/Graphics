The Learning Templates sample is a collection of VFX assets designed to help you learn about VFX Graph concepts and features. This collection will be updated based on community feedback and new features. This page provides instructions on how to install the sample, a brief overview of the content, and how to make the most of it.

## Requirements

This sample content is compatible with both URP and HDRP projects, for VFX Graph versions 16.0 and later.

## Installing the VFX Learning Templates

To install this sample, first [install the Visual Effect Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@17.0/manual/GettingStarted.html#installing-visual-effect-graph), then:


 1. Go to **Window** > **Package Management** > **Package Manager**.
 1. From the [Package list view](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.3/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html), select **Visual Effect Graph**.

1. If it is not there: 
   1. From the [Packages drop-down menu](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html), select **Unity Registry** or **In Project**.
   1. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Package Manager**
   1. In the **Advanced Settings** drop-down, enable **Show Dependencies**. Visual Effect Graph should now appear in the Packages list view.
1. In the main window that displays the package's details, find the **Samples** section.
1. To import the sample into your project, click **Import**. This creates a folder called `Samples` in your project, and imports the sample you selected into it. Unity imports any future samples into this folder.

#### **Hierarchy**
   1. **Sample Showcase**:

      The `Sample_Showcase` GameObject has a script called **Samples Showcase**, which contains a custom Inspector and a dedicated window. Select this GameObject to view information and useful links relative to each VFX in the [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.3/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html).

   1. **Scene Main Camera**:

      - This camera is used for the game view, and its viewpoint is controlled by the **Showcase** script. In Play mode, you can freely move the camera around.

#### **Views**

   4. **Scene View**:

         - You can use the Scene view to move around freely to find a VFX that interests you. Note that some visual effects require the Editor to be in Play mode.

   4. **Game View**:

      - You can use the Game view to focus on each VFX separately, via the Sample Showcase actions that control the camera. If you prefer to explore freely, you can use the Main Camera.

### Inside a VFX

The best way to learn and understand how a VFX has been made is to look inside. Take a look at the different parts of the Graph and the embedded notes.
