# Velocity Blocks

Dynamically adjust the velocity of particles.

| **Page** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Velocity from Direction & Speed (Change Speed)](Block-VelocityFromDirectionAndSpeed(ChangeSpeed).md) | Calculate velocity by scaling the direction of the particle using its speed. |
| [Velocity from Direction & Speed (New Direction)](Block-VelocityFromDirectionAndSpeed(NewDirection).md) | Calculate velocity by scaling a new direction vector using the speed of the particle. |
| [Velocity from Direction & Speed (Random Direction)](Block-VelocityFromDirectionAndSpeed(RandomDirection).md) | Calculate velocity by scaling a random direction vector using the speed of the particle. |
| [Velocity from Direction & Speed (Spherical)](Block-VelocityFromDirectionAndSpeed(Spherical).md) | Calculate velocity by scaling a spherical direction vector using the speed of the particle. |
| [Velocity from Direction & Speed (Tangent)](Block-VelocityFromDirectionAndSpeed(Tangent).md) | Calculate velocity by scaling a tangent direction vector using the speed of the particle. |
