// This example blits the active CameraColor to a new texture. It shows how to do a blit with material, and how to use the ResourceData to avoid another blit back to the active color target.
// This example is for API demonstrative purposes. 

// This pass blits the whole screen for a given material to a temp texture, and swaps the UniversalResourceData.cameraColor to this temp texture.
// Therefore, the next pass that references the cameraColor will reference this new temp texture as the cameraColor, saving us a blit. 
// Using the ResourceData, you can manage swapping of resources yourself and don't need a bespoke API like the SwapColorBuffer API that was specific for the cameraColor. 
// This allows you to write more decoupled passes without the added costs of avoidable copies/blits.
