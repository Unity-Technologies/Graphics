# Terrain Lit shader

URP uses the Terrain Lit shader for Unity Terrain. This shader is a simpler version of the [Lit shader](lit-shader). 

For more information about Terrain Layers, refer to [Terrain Layers](../class-TerrainLayer.md).

## Terrain Lit Material properties

A Terrain Lit shader has the following properties.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Enable Height-based Blend** | Enable to have Unity take the height values from the blue channel of the **Mask Map** Texture.<br/><br/>If you do not enable this property, Unity blends the Terrain Layers based on the weights painted in the splatmap Textures. When you disable this property and the Terrain Lit Shader Material is assigned to a Terrain, URP adds an additional option **Opacity as Density Blend** for each Terrain Layer that is added to that Terrain in the Paint Texture Tool Inspector.<br/><br/>**Note**: Unity ignores this option when more than four Terrain Layers are on the Terrain. |
| &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Height Transition* | Select the size in world units of the smooth transition area between Terrain Layers. |
| **Enable Per-pixel Normal**   | Enable to have Unity sample the normal map Texture on a per-pixel level, preserving more geometry details for distant terrain parts. Unity generates a geometry normal map at runtime from the heightmap, rather than the Mesh geometry. This means you can have high-resolution Mesh normals, even if your Mesh is low resolution.<br/><br/>**Note**: This option only works if you enable **Draw Instanced** on the Terrain. |

## Create a Terrain Lit Material

To create a Material compatible with a Terrain GameObject:

1. Create a new Material (**Assets** > **Create** > **Material**).
2. Select the new Material.
3. In the Inspector, click the **Shader** drop-down, and select **Universal&#160;Render&#160;Pipeline** > **Terrain** > **Lit**.

## Assign a Terrain Lit Material to a Terrain GameObject

To assign a Terrain Lit Material to a Terrain GameObject:

1. Select a Terrain GameObject.
2. In the Inspector, click the gear icon on the right side of the Terrain Inspector toolbar to open the **Terrain Settings** section.
3. In the **Material** property, select a Terrain Lit Material. Either use the Object picker (circle icon), or drag and drop the Material onto the property.

## Using the Paint Holes Tool

To use the **Paint Holes** tool on a Terrain, ensure that the **Terrain Holes** check box in your project's URP Asset is checked. Otherwise, the Terrain holes are absent when you build the application.
