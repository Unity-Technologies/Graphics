# View and manipulate Lights from their perspective

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) includes the Light Placement Tool which you can use to view a Scene from a light source’s perspective. You can use this tool to move and modify any type of light source.

This tool does not affect any Cameras in your Scene. The Scene View Camera returns to its original position when you disable the Light Placement Tool.
