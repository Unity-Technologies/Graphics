# Lighting in the Universal Render Pipeline

All of Unity's render pipelines share common lighting functionality, but each render pipeline has some important differences.

Areas where the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) differs from Unity's common lighting functionality are:

* The [Light component inspector](../light-component.md), which displays some URP-specific controls.
* The [Universal Additional Light Data](../universal-additional-light-data.md) component, which allows Unity to store Light-related data that is specific to URP.

For a full comparison of lighting features between Unity's Built-in Render Pipeline and URP, and an up to date list of lighting features that are currently under research, check the [Render pipeline feature comparison](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/render-pipelines-feature-comparison.html).

For a general introduction to lighting in Unity and examples of common lighting workflows, refer to the [Lighting section of the Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html).
