    description: 'A Shader Graph terrain shader that closely mimics the feature set
      of the code version of the terrain shader. With this template, you can extend
      or simplify the functionality of the terrain shader to suit the needs of your
      project including adding or removing layers.


      In URP, if the terrain
      has more than 4 layers, the shader is rendered again in a second pass for each
      additional set of 4 layers. So this shader with 4 layers can also be used for
      a terrain with 8 or more layers.


      For more ideas and examples of how
      to work with terrain shaders, import the Terrain Shaders sample from the Shader
      Graph package in the Package Manager.
