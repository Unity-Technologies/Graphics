	"""Welcome to the Water System Samples.
	The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/water.html">WaterSystem</a> allows you to add water to your scenes.
	Multiple surface types are available, this scene showcases the Ocean preset.
	
	<i>To make sure the project is set up properly, use the HDRP Asset Settings Helper buttons at the top of this component, otherwise some features might not be visible.</i>
	
The project uses the Mask and Current Water Decal workflow. Make sure it is enabled in the Graphics settings first. 
    
<h1>Water Decal</h1>

On this scene, a single <link="Water Decal">Water Decal</link> is used to do multiple things:
• To mask part of the swell and agitation closer to the island using the "Affect Simulation Mask" checkbox
• This same water simulation mask texture in also used in the Water Decal <link="Island_WaterDecal.shadergraph">Shader Graph</link> to mask the foam where the simulation is masked.
• Lastly, a Current Map Texture is applied as well on the Water Surface to slightly change the direction of the current around the island using the "Affect Large Current" checkbox in the <link="Island_WaterDecal.mat">material</link>.

<h1>Exclusion</h1>
	
• A <link="Water Excluder">Water Excluder</link> with a specifically authored mesh is set on the boat to exclude water from rendering inside it.
	
<h1>Shores Waves</h1>
	
• There are 3 different <link="Water Wave Deformer Middle">Shore Wave Water Deformers</link>. Each Water Deformer has a <link="DecalTriggerDummy">child gameobject</link>. It’s used to trigger a <link="ShoreFoam">Decal Projector</link> when submerged underwater. To prevent unwanted effects, the trigger script ignores the general water agitation and only calculates if the dummy gets submerged due to a wave deformation.
• The Decal Projector has a component 'FoamShore' controling the scale, opacity and position, effectively describing how far can the wave decals be seen after reaching the shore.
• In addition, the Decal Projector Material is animated using a flipbook texture.
• Moreover, each Decal has a child <link="Water Texture Deformer">Deformer</link> with the same animated texture for the foam to have "volume". This deformer is triggered at the same time and uses one shared <link="Shader Graphs_Custom Foam Flipbook">material</link> with a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html">Material Property Block</a> for all Water Deformers, eliminating the need for a Custom Render Texture.
• Finally, a very large <link="Decal Projector Wave Foam">Decal Projector</link> retrieves the foam texture of the Shore Wave Deformers using the <code>GetFoamBuffer()</code> function to further blend the foam on the shore.
		
<h1>Third Person Sailor</h1>
	
• The <link="Sailor">Sailor</link> works only in <b>Play Mode</b>.
• Use the direction arrows of your keyboard to move the sailor.
• The gameObject <link="DeformerPool">Deformer Pool</link> holds a list of deformers to use as children for deformations.
• When the controller is moving, the component <b>CharacterControllerSpawnDeformation</b> enables <b>Water Deformers</b> continuously in the <link="DeformerPool">Deformer Pool</link> child list just ahead of the character. These deformers are then animated and faded, making ripples. 
• The <link="Sailor Foam Generator">foam generator</link> is also scaled by its parent transform based on the controller velocity to generate foam trail that disappears over time. This foam can also be visible on the sand since there's a <link="Decal Projector Wave Foam">decal</link> reprojecting it on the shore.
