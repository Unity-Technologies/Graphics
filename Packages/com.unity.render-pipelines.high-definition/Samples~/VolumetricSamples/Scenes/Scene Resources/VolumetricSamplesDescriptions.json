	The Local Fog visual quality is dependent on the <b>Volumetric Fog quality settings</b>, found in the active <b>Volume Profile</b>. The Manual control offers precise management over the Fog's budget : for an effect with lots of variation over a short distance, it is preferred to increase the <b>Volume Slice Count</b>. If performance is an issue, the <b>Screen Resolution Percentage</b> can be kept low as a tradeoff.""",
