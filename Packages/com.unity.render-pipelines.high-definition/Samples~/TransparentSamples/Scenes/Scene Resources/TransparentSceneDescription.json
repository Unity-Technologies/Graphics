	"""Welcome to HDRP samples scene about Transparency. We will be covering the following topics:

• <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/refraction-models.html">Refraction Models</a>
• Stacking transparent objects.
• Shadows casted by object with transparent materials.
• Custom Refraction using Shader Graph.

In <b>Rasterization</b>, which is the classic rendering mode for real time 3D, transparent rendering has some limitations. For instance, computing refraction is taxing, so there are a few Refraction Models available, which can efficiently approximate refraction for various use cases.

<b>If DXR is enabled</b> on the project, it allows you to render some objects or effects using <b>Ray Tracing</b>, such as:

• <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Ray-Tracing-Recursive-Rendering.html">Recursive Rendering</a> for objects that have Recursive Rendering checked on their materials
• <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Ray-Traced-Shadows.html">Ray-Traced Shadows</a> for lights.
• <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Ray-Tracing-Path-Tracing.html">Path Tracing</a>, while still not adapted for games, can be used to render physically accurate images without the need for approximations. 

Use the dropdown to instantiate a Volume Profile that enables <b>Recursive Rendering</b>, <b>Ray Traced Shadows</b> or <b>Path Tracing</b> for this scene.
