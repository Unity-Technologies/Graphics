# Scripting in the water system

You can make boats, floating debris, or other objects match the curvature of the water dynamically.

To align objects correctly with the water surface you can retrieve the normal of the surface at a given point. You can thus ensure objects move or rotate appropriately relative to the surface's real-time changes.
