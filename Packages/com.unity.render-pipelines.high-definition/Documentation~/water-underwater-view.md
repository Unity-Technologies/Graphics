# Underwater view

To view non-infinite water surfaces from underwater, you have to specify a [collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Glossary.html#Collider). You can either use the box collider HDRP automatically provides or select a box collider in the scene to use for this purpose.

To view infinite water surfaces from underwater, you have to specify a **Volume Depth**.
