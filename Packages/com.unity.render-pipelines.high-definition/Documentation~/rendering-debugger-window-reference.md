<a name="DecalsPanel"></a>

## Decals panel

The **Decals** panel has tools that you can use to debug [decals](decal-material-inspector-reference.md) affecting transparent objects in your project.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Display Atlas** | Enable the checkbox to display the decal atlas for a Camera in the top left of that Camera's view. |
| **Mip Level** | Use the slider to select the mip level for the decal atlas. The higher the mip level, the blurrier the decal atlas. |

<a name="StatsPanel"></a>

## Display Stats panel

The **display stats** panel is only visible in play mode. You can use it to debug performance issues in your project.

Use the [runtime shortcuts](#Navigation at runtime) to open the Display stats window in the scene view at runtime.

### Frame Stats

The Frame Stats section displays the average, minimum, and maximum value of each property. HDRP calculates each Frame Stat value over the 30 most recent frames.

| **Property** | | **Description** |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frame Rate** | | The frame rate (in frames per second) for the current camera view. |
| **Frame Time** | | The total frame time for the current camera view. |
| **CPU Main Thread Frame** | | The total time (in milliseconds) between the start of the frame and the time when the Main Thread finished the job. |
| **CPU Render Thread Frame** | | The time (in milliseconds) between the start of the work on the Render Thread and the time Unity waits to render the present frame ([Gfx.PresentFrame](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/profiler-markers.html)). |
| **CPU Present Wait** | | The time (in milliseconds) that the CPU spent waiting for Unity to render the present frame ([Gfx.PresentFrame](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/profiler-markers.html)) during the last frame. |
| **GPU Frame** | | The amount of time (in milliseconds) the GPU takes to render a given frame. |
| **RT Mode** | | When you [enable ray tracing](Ray-Tracing-Getting-Started.md), this property shows the ray tracing quality mode that HDRP uses during rendering. HDRP updates this value once every frame based on the previous frame. |
| **Count Rays** | | Count the number of traced rays for each effect (in MRays / frame). This property only appears when you enable ray tracing. |
| | **Ambient Occlusion** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for [Ambient Occlusion (AO)](Ambient-Occlusion.md) computations, when you enable realtime ambient occlusion (RT AO). |
| | **Shadows Directional** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for [directional lights](Light-Component.md) when you enable ray-traced shadows. |
| | **Shadows Area** | The number of rays that HDRP traced towards area lights when you enable [ray-traced shadows](Ray-Traced-Shadows.md). |
| | **Shadows Point/Spot** | The number of rays that HDRP traced towards point and spot lights when you enable ray-traced shadows. |
| | **Reflection Forward** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for reflection computations that use [forward shading](Forward-And-Deferred-Rendering.md). |
| | **Reflection Deferred** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for reflection computations that use [deferred shading](Forward-And-Deferred-Rendering.md). |
| | **Diffuse GI Forward** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for diffuse [Global Illumination (GI)](Ray-Traced-Global-Illumination.md) computations that use forward shading. |
| | **Diffuse GI Deferred** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for diffuse Global Illumination (GI) computations that use deferred shading. |
| | **Recursive** | The number of rays that HDRP traced for diffuse Global Illumination (GI) computations when you enable recursive ray tracing. |
| | **Total** | The total number of rays that HDRP traced. |
| **Debug XR Layout** | | Display debug information for XR passes. <br>This mode is only available in editor and development builds. |

<a name="bottlenecks"></a>

### Bottlenecks

A bottleneck is a condition that occurs when one process performs significantly slower than other components, and other components depend on it. 

The **Bottlenecks** section describes the distribution of the last 60 frames across the CPU and GPU. You can only see the Bottleneck information when you build your player on a device. 

**Note**: Vsync limits the **Frame Rate** based on the refresh rate of your deviceâ€™s screen. This means when you enable Vsync, the **Present Limited** category is 100% in most cases. To turn Vsync off, go to **Edit** > **Project settings** > **Quality** > **Current Active Quality Level** and set the **Vsync Count** set to **Don't Sync**.

#### Bottleneck categories

| **Category** | **Description** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CPU** | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the CPU limited the frame time. |
| **GPU** | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the GPU limited the frame time. |
| **Present limited** | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the frame time was limited by the following presentation constraints:<br>&bull; Vertical Sync (Vsync): Vsync synchronizes rendering to the refresh rate of your display.<br>&bull;[Target framerate]([Application.targetFrameRate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html)): A function that you can use to manually limit the frame rate of an application. If a frame is ready before the time you specify in targetFrameRate, Unity waits before presenting the frame. |
| **Balanced** | This percentage of the last 60 frames in which the frame time was not limited by any of the above categories. A frame that is 100% balanced indicates the processing time for both CPU and GPU is approximately equal. |

#### Bottleneck example

If Vsync limited 20 of the 60 most recent frames, the Bottleneck section might appear as follows: 

- **CPU** 0.0%: This indicates that HDRP did not render any of the last 60 frames on the CPU.
- **GPU** 66.6%: This indicates that the GPU limited 66.6% of the 60 most recent frames rendered by HDRP.
- **Present Limited** 33.3%: This indicates that presentation constraints (Vsync or the [target framerate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html)) limited 33.3% of the last 60 frames.
- **Balanced** 0.0%: This indicates that in the last 60 frames, there were 0 frames where the CPU processing time and GPU processing time were the same.

In this example, the bottleneck is the GPU.

<a name="detailed-stats"></a>

### Detailed Stats

The Detailed Stats section displays the amount of time in milliseconds that each rendering step takes on the CPU and GPU. HDRP updates these values once every frame based on the previous frame. 

| **Property** | **Description** |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Update every second with average | Calculate average values over one second and update every second. |
| Hide empty scopes | Hide profiling scopes that use 0.00ms of processing time on the CPU and GPU. |
| Count Rays | Count the number of traced rays for each effect (in MRays / frame). This mode only appears when you enable ray tracing. |
| Debug XR Layout | Enable to display debug information for [XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html) passes. This mode only appears in the editor and development builds. |

<a name="MaterialPanel"></a>

## Material panel

The **Material** panel has tools that you can use to visualize different Material properties.

Refer to [Fix issues with Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-fixissues.md) for more information about probe validity.</li><li><strong>Probe Validity Over Dilation Threshold</strong>: Display red if a probe samples too many backfaces, based on the **Validity Threshold** set in the [Adaptive Probe Volumes panel](probevolumes-lighting-panel-reference.md). This means the probe can't be baked or sampled.</li><li><strong>Invalidated By Touchup Volumes</strong>: Display probes that a [Probe Adjustment Volume component](probevolumes-adjustment-volume-component-reference.md) has made invalid.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Display a different color for each size of [brick](probevolumes-concept.md).</li><li><strong>Sky Occlusion SH</strong>: If you enable [sky occlusion](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md), this setting displays the amount of indirect light the probe receives from the sky that bounced off static GameObjects. The value is a scalar, so it displays as a shade of gray.</li><li><strong>Sky Direction</strong>: Display a green circle that represents the direction from the probe to the sky. This setting displays a red circle if Unity can't calculate the direction, or **Sky Direction** in the [Adaptive Probe Volumes panel](probevolumes-lighting-panel-reference.md) is disabled.</li></ul>|
|| **Debug Size** | Set the size of the displayed probes. The default is 0.3. |
|| **Exposure Compensation** | Set the brightness of the displayed probes. Decrease the value to increase brightness. The default is 0. This property appears only if you set **Probe Shading Mode** to **SH**, **SHL0**, or **SHL0L1**. |

### Streaming

Use the following properties to control how HDRP streams Adaptive Probe Volumes. Refer to [Streaming Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-streaming.md) for more information.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Freeze Streaming** | Stop Unity from streaming probe data. |
| **Display Streaming Score** | If you enable **Display Cells**, this setting darkens cells that have a lower priority for streaming. Cells closer to the camera usually have the highest priority. |
| **Maximum cell streaming** | Stream as many cells as possible every frame. |
| **Display Index Fragmentation** | Open an overlay that displays how fragmented the streaming memory is. A green square is an area of used memory. The more spaces between the green squares, the more fragmented the memory. |
| **Index Fragmentation Rate** | Displays the amount of fragmentation as a numerical value, where 0 is no fragmentation. |
| **Verbose Log** | Log information about streaming. |

### Scenario Blending

Use the following properties to control how HDRP blends Lighting Scenarios. Refer to [Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios](probevolumes-bakedifferentlightingsetups.md) for more information.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| **Number of Cells Blended Per Frame** | Determines the maximum number of cells Unity blends per frame. The default is 10,000. |
| **Turnover Rate** | Set the blending priority of cells close to the camera. The range is 0 to 1, where 0 sets the cells close to the camera with high priority, and 1 sets all cells with equal priority. Increase **Turnover Rate** to avoid cells close to the camera blending too frequently. |
| **Scenario To Blend With** | Select a Lighting Scenario to blend with the active Lighting Scenario. |
| **Scenario Blending Factor** | Set how far to blend from the active Lighting Scenario to the **Scenario To Blend With**. The range is 0 to 1, where 0 is fully the active Lighting Scenario, and 1 is fully the **Scenario To Blend With**. |

<a name="RenderingPanel"></a>

## Rendering panel

The **Rendering** panel has tools that you can use to visualize various HDRP rendering features.

### Fullscreen Debug Mode

Use the drop-down to select a rendering mode to display as an overlay on the screen.

| Property | Description |
|-|-|
| **Motion Vectors** | Select this option to display motion vectors. Note that object motion vectors aren't visible in the Scene view. |
| **World Space Position** | Select this option to display world space positions. |
| **NaN Tracker** | Select this option to display an overlay that highlights [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) values. |
| **ColorLog** | Select this option to display how the raw, log-encoded buffer looks before color grading takes place. |
| **DepthOfFieldCoc** | Select this option to display the circle of confusion for the depth of field effect. The circle of confusion displays how much the depth of field effect blurs a given pixel/area. |
| **Quad Overdraw** | Select this option to display an overlay that highlights gpu quads running multiple fragment shaders. This is mainly caused by small or thin triangles. Use LODs to reduce the amount of overdraw when objects are far away. (This mode is currently not supported on Metal and PS4). |
| **Vertex Density** | Select this option to display an overlay that highlights pixels running multiple vertex shaders. A vertex can be run multiple times when part of different triangles. This helps finding models that need LODs. (This mode is currently not supported on Metal). |
| **TransparencyOverdraw** | Select this option to view the number of transparent pixels that draw over one another. This represents the amount of on-screen overlapping of transparent pixel. This is useful to see the amount of pixel overdraw for transparent GameObjects from different points of view in the Scene. This debug option displays each pixel as a heat map going from black (which represents no transparent pixels) through blue to red (at which there are **Max Pixel Cost** number of transparent pixels). |
| **RequestedVirtualTextureTiles** | Select this option to display what texture tile each pixel uses. Pixels that this debug view renders with the same color request the same texture tile to be streamed into video memory by the streaming virtual texturing system. This debug view is useful to see which areas of the screen use textures that the virtual texturing system steams into video memory. It can help to identify issues with the virtual texture streaming system. |
| **LensFlareScreenSpace** | Display the lens flares that the [Screen Space Lens Flare](shared/lens-flare/Override-Screen-Space-Lens-Flare.html) override generates. |
| **Compute Thickness** | Select this option to display thickness for each layer selected in the current HDRP Asset and configure the following properties:<br/> &#8226; **Layer Mask**: Set the layer number to visualize in the debug view.<br/> &#8226; **Show Overlap Count**: Highlight the triangles that intersect for each pixel.<br/> &#8226; **Thickness Scale**: Set the range (in meters) of the ComputeThickness debug view. When you enable Show Overlap Count, this setting affects the Overlap Count debug view. <br/>For more information on how to debug compute thickness, refer to [Sample and use material thickness](Compute-Thickness.md). |
| **Max Pixel Cost** | The scale of the transparency overdraw heat map. For example, a value of 10 displays a red pixel if 10 transparent pixels overlap. Any number of overdraw above this value also displays as red.<br/>This property only appears if you set **Fullscreen Debug Mode** to **TransparencyOverdraw**. |
| **High Quality Lines** | Select this option to view underlying data used by tile-based software rasterizer for the [High Quality Line Rendering](Override-High-Quality-Lines.md) feature.<ul><li> **Segments per Tile** displays a heatmap representing the number of segments in each tile. </li><li>**Tile Processor UV** displays the uv coordinate for each tile.</li><li>**Cluster Depth** displays segments based on their depth in the cluster structure that's used for transparent sorting.</li></ul> |

### Mipmap Streaming

| **Property** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| **Disable Mip Caching** | If you enable **Disable Mip Caching**, Unity doesn't cache mipmap levels in GPU memory, and constantly discards mipmap levels from GPU memory when they're no longer needed. This means the mipmap streaming debug views more accurately display which mipmap levels Unity uses at the current time. Enabling this setting increases the amount of data Unity transfers from disk to the CPU and the GPU. |
| **Debug View** | Set a mipmap streaming debug view. Options:<ul><li>**None**: Display the normal view.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Performance**: Use color to indicate which textures use mipmap streaming, and whether mipmap streaming limits the number of mipmap levels Unity loads.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Status**: Use color on materials to indicate whether their textures use mipmap streaming. Diagonal stripes mean some of the textures use a [`requestedMipmapLevel`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D-requestedMipmapLevel.html) that overrides mipmap streaming. Yellow means Unity can't stream the texture, or the texture is assigned to terrain.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Activity**: Use color to indicate whether Unity recently streamed the textures.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Priority**: Use color to indicate the streaming priority of the textures. Set streaming priority for a texture in the [**Texture Import Settings** window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html).</li><li>**Mip Count**: Display the number of mipmap levels Unity loads for the textures.</li><li>**Mip Ratio**: Use color to indicate the pixel density of the highest-resolution mipmap levels Unity uploads for the textures.</li></ul> |
| **Debug Opacity** | Set the opacity of the **Debug View** you select. 0 means not visible and 1 means fully visible. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |
| **Combined Per Material** | Set the **Debug View** to display debug information of all the textures on a material, not individual texture slots. This property is only visible if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Status** or **Mip Streaming Activity**. |
| **Material Texture Slot** | Set which texture Unity uses from each material to display debug information. For example, set **Material Texture Slot** to **Slot 3** to display debug information for the fourth texture. If a material has fewer textures than the **Material Texture Slot** value, Unity uses no texture. This property is visible only if **Combined Per Material** is disabled, and **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |
| **Display Status Codes** | Display more detailed statuses for textures that display as **Not streaming** or **Warning** in the **Mip Streaming Status** debug view. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Status**. |
| **Activity Timespan** | Set how long a texture displays as **Just streamed**, in seconds. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Activity**. |
| **Terrain Texture** | Set which terrain texture Unity displays. You can select either **Control** for the control texture, or one of the diffuse textures. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |

### Color Picker

The **Color Picker** works with whichever debug mode HDRP displays at the time. This means that you can see the values of various components of the rendering like Albedo or Diffuse Lighting. By default, this displays the value of the main High Dynamic Range (HDR) color buffer.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Debug Mode** | Use the drop-down to select the format of the color picker display. |
| **Font Color** | Use the color picker to select a color for the font that the Color Picker uses for its display. |

### Color Monitors

The **Color monitors** are a set of industry-standard monitors to help artists control the overall look and exposure of a scene.

| **Property** | **Description**    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Waveform** | Displays the full range of luma (brightness) information in the Cameraâ€™s output. The horizontal axis of the graph corresponds to the render (from left to right) and the vertical axis indicates the brightness value.   |
| **Exposure** | Determines the exposure multiplier HDRP applies to the waveform values.<br/><br/>This property only appears when you enable the **Waveform** checkbox.   |
| **Parade mode** | Splits the image into red, green and blue separately. You can use this to visualise the RGB balance of the Camera's image. This helps you to see large offsets in one particular channel, or to determine if GameObjects are true black or true white. A true black, white, or grey GameObject has equal values across all channels.<br/><br/>This property only appears when you enable the **Waveform** checkbox.  |
| **Vectorscope** | The Vectorscope monitor measures the overall range of hue and saturation within the Cameraâ€™s image in real-time. To display the data, it uses a scatter graph relative to the center of the Vectorscope.<br/><br/>The Vectorscope measures hue values between yellow, red, magenta, blue, cyan and green. The center of the Vectorscope represents absolute zero saturation and the edges represent the highest level of saturation. To determine the hues in your scene and their saturation, look at the distribution of the Vectorscopeâ€™s scatter graph.<br/>To identify whether there is a color imbalance in the image, look at how close the middle of the Vectorscope graph is to the absolute center. If the Vectorscope graph is off-center, this indicates that there is a color cast (tint) in the image. |
| **Exposure** | Determines the exposure multiplier HDRP applies to the vectorscope values.<br/><br/>This property only appears when you enable the **Vectorscope** checkbox.   |
| **Size** | The size ratio of the color monitors.   |

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Clear Render Targets At Creation**  | Clears render textures the first time the render graph system uses them. |
| **Clear Render Targets When Freed**  | Clears render textures when they're no longer used by render graph. |
| **Disable Pass Culling** | Disables HDRP culling render passes that have no impact on the final render. |
| **Disable Pass Merging** | Disables HDRP merging render passes. |
| **Immediate Mode** | Enables the render graph system evaluating passes immediately after it creates them. |
| **Enable Logging** | Enables logging to the **Console** window. |
| **Log Frame Information** | Logs how HDRP uses the resources during the frame, in the **Console** window. |
| **Log Resources** | Logs the resources HDRP uses during the frame, in the **Console** window. |

The **NVIDIA device debug view** is a panel that displays a list of the current feature states of NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). Each row represents an active screen in which DLSS is running.

| **Information** | **Description** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **NVUnityPlugin Version**| Displays the current internal version id of the NVIDIA Unity Plugin that interacts with DLSS. |
| **NGX API Version** | Displays the actual version which DLSS operates on. |
| **Device Status** | Displays the current status of the NVIDIA driver. If an internal error occurred when initializing the driver, Unity displays the error here. |
| **DLSS Supported** | Displays **True** if your project supports DLSS at runtime. Otherwise, displays **False**. |
| **DLSS Slot ID** | Displays an internal ID for the particular DLSS view being displayed. |
| **Status** | Displays whether the view is **valid** or **invalid**. A view is invalid if there is an internal error, or if the Scriptable Render Pipeline passes incorrect parameters. |
| **Input resolution** | Displays the current input resolution. Unity calculates this from the screen percentage specified for dynamic resolution scaling. |
| **Output resolution** | Displays the target resolution for this particular DLSS view. |
| **Quality** | Displays the quality selected for this particular DLSS view. |

The **History Buffers view** lets you display various render pipeline full screen buffers that persist across multiple frames.

| **Property**   | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Buffer**         | Choose the history buffer to visualize as a full screen output. |
| **Frame Index**    | Choose what frame version of the history buffer to visualize. Certain buffers only have a limited number of versions. |
| **Apply Exposure** | Enable exposure correction of the buffer. It is only available for certain history buffers. |

<a name="CameraPanel"></a>

## Camera panels

In the **Rendering Debugger**, each active Camera in the Scene has its own debug window. Use the Camera's debug window to temporarily change that Camera's [Frame Settings](Frame-Settings.md) without altering the Camera data in the Scene. The Camera window helps you to understand why a specific feature doesn't work correctly. You can access all the information that HDRP uses the render the Camera you select.

**Note**: The Camera debug window is only available for Cameras, not Reflection Probes.

The following columns are available for each Frame Setting:

| **Column** | **Description** |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Debug** | Displays Frame Setting values you can modify for the selected Camera. You can use these to temporarily alter the Cameraâ€™s Frame Settings for debugging purposes. You can't enable Frame Setting features that your HDRP Asset doesn't support. |
| **Sanitized** | Displays the Frame Setting values that the selected Camera uses after Unity checks to see if your HDRP Asset supports them. |
| **Overridden** | Displays the Frame Setting values that the selected Camera overrides. If you don't check the **Custom Frame Settings** checkbox, check it and don't override any settings, this column is identical to the **Default** column. |
| **Default** | Displays the default Frame Setting values in your current [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md). |

Unity processes **Sanitized**, **Overridden**, and **Default** in a specific order:

1. It checks the **Default** Frame Settings
2. It checks the selected Cameraâ€™s **Overridden** Frame Settings.
3. It checks whether the HDRP Asset supports the selected Cameraâ€™s Frame Settings
4. It displays that result in the **Sanitized** column.

### Interpreting the Camera window

![](Images/RenderPipelineDebug2.png)

- In the image above, **Ray Tracing** is disabled at the **Sanitized** step, but enabled at the **Default** and **Overridden** steps. This means that, although **Ray Tracing** is enabled in the Frame Settings this Camera uses, it's not enabled in the HDRP Assetâ€™s **Render Pipeline Supported Features**.
- Also in the image above, **Decals** is disabled at the **Overridden** step, but enabled at the **Default** step. This means that **Decals** is enabled in the default Camera Frame Settings but disabled for that specific Cameraâ€™s **Custom Frame Settings**.

<a name="VirtualTexturingPanel"></a>

## Virtual Texturing panel

You can use the **Virtual Texturing** panel to visualize [Streaming Virtual Texturing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/svt-streaming-virtual-texturing.html).

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Debug disable Feedback Streaming** | Deactivate Streaming Virtual Texturing to quickly assess its cost in performance and memory at runtime. |
| **Textures with Preloaded Mips** | Display the total number of virtual textures Unity has loaded into the scene. Unity tries to preload the least detailed mipmap level (least being 128x128) into GPU memory. This number increases every time a material is loaded. |
