<td>

Indicates whether the render pipeline excludes this surface from any temporal upscalers (TU) and temporal anti-aliasing (AA). This is useful when the surface looks blurry when TAA or any Temporal Upscaler is enabled and especially useful for animated textures (such as video player in a surface).
This setting only works for Transparent surfaces due to the fact that there are no more stencil bits open.
