<td>Specifies the method HDRP uses to calculate the lighting in the eye's iris:<br/>&#8226; <strong>Eye</strong>: Uses a low resource-intensity method to calculate caustics.<br/>&#8226; <strong>Eye Cinematic</strong>: Refracts incoming light to create more realistic lighting. This is the algorithm used in <a href="https://unity.com/the-heretic">The Heretic</a>. This method is more resource-intensive than <strong>Eye</strong>.<br/>&#8226; <strong>Eye Cinematic With Caustic</strong>: Uses refracted light direction and caustic approximation to shade the iris. This is the algorithm used in <a href="https://unity.com/demos/enemies">Enemies</a>. This method is the most resource intensive.</td>
