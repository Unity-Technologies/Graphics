Indicates whether to turn on alpha-to-coverage. If your Project uses MSAA, alpha-to-coverage modifies the multi-sample coverage mask proportionally to the pixel shader result alpha value. This is typically used for anti-aliasing vegetation and other alpha-tested shaders.<br/>This property only appears if you enable <strong>Alpha Clipping</strong>.
