  <td>Determines how HDRP handles a material with regards to Double Sided GI. When selecting Auto, Double-Sided GI is enabled if the material is Double-Sided; otherwise selecting On or Off respectively enables or disables double sided GI regardless of the material's Double-Sided option. When enabled, the lightmapper accounts for both sides of the geometry when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces aren't rendered or added to lightmaps, but get treated as valid when seen from other objects. When using the Progressive Lightmapper backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces. (Currently this setting is only available when baking with the Progressive Lightmapper backend.).</td>
