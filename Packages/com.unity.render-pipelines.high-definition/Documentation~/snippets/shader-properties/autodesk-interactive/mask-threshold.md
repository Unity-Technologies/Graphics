<td>The opacity threshold HDRP uses to to determine which areas of the <strong>MaskMap</strong> render as transparent or completely opaque. For example, for a <strong>MaskThreshold</strong> value of 0.5, a pixel in the <strong>MaskMap</strong> with a value of 0.6 appears completely opaque and a pixel with a value of 0.4 appears completely transparent.</td>
