# Water decals

To create foam, deformation, or water currents, you can use a water decal. Water decals add localized water effects to a specific region in a 3D scene. This region is anchored in world space to a GameObject transform or, by default, to the camera. Use water decals to easily replicate effects across multiple regions, such as around islands or shorelines, without re-authoring textures.

For example, you can use water decals to add foam, attenuate swell, fine-tune currents, or create shoreline waves around an island. Then, you can replicate this setup by duplicating the decals to apply the same localized effects to another island, without re-authoring textures.
