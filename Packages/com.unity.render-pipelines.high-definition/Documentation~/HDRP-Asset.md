# The High Definition Render Pipeline Asset

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) Asset controls the global rendering settings of your Project and creates an instance of the render pipeline.

Unity only allocates memory and builds shader variants for features you enable in the HDRP Asset. This means that you can disable features your project does not use to save memory. Since certain features require shader variants or other resources when Unity builds your project, you can only enable and disable features at edit time. However, it is possible to toggle the rendering of particular features at runtime, just not using the HDRP Asset. Instead, [Frame-Settings](Frame-Settings.md) control the features that cameras in the scene render. Frame Settings can only toggle features that are enabled in the HDRP Asset; they cannot enable features that are disabled.

## Rendering

| **Property** | **Sub-property** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| **Color Buffer Format**                  || The format of the color buffer that HDRP uses for rendering. Using R16G16B16A16 instead of R11G11B10 doubles the memory usage, but helps avoid banding. R16G16B16A16 is also required for [Alpha-Output](Alpha-Output.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Lit Shader Mode**                      || Use the drop-down to choose which mode HDRP uses for the [Lit Shader](lit-material.md).<br />&#8226; **Forward Only**: forces HDRP to only use forward rendering for Lit Shaders.<br />&#8226; **Deferred Only**: forces HDRP to use deferred rendering for Lit Shaders (HDRP still renders advanced Materials using forward rendering).<br />&#8226; **Both**: allows the Camera to use deferred and forward rendering.<br /><br />Select **Both** to allow you to switch between forward and deferred rendering for Lit Shaders at runtime per Camera. Selecting a specific mode reduces build time and Shader memory because HDRP requires less Shader variants, but it is not possible to switch from one mode to the other at runtime. |
| **- Multisample Anti-aliasing Quality**  || Use the drop-down to set the number of samples HDRP uses for multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA). The larger the sample count, the better the quality. Select **None** to disable MSAA.<br />This property is only visible when **Lit Shader Mode** is set to **Forward Only** or **Both**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Motion Vectors**                       || Enable the checkbox to enable motion vector support in HDRP. HDRP uses motion vectors for effects like screen space reflection (SSR) and motion blur. When disabled, motion blur has no effect and HDRP calculates SSR with lower quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Runtime Debug Display**                || Enable the checkbox to enable HDRP to use debug modes from the [Rendering Debugger](use-the-rendering-debugger.md) at runtime. Disable the checkbox to reduce build time and shader memory. This disables all property override options, all lighting debug modes, and all material property debug modes except GBuffer debug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Runtime AOV API**                      || Enable the checkbox to enable HDRP able to use the AOV API (rendering of material properties and lighting modes) at runtime. Disable this checkbox to reduce build time and shader memory. This disables all material properties and lighting modes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Terrain Hole**                         || Enable the checkbox to enable suppot for [Terrain Holes](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/terrain-PaintHoles.html) in HDRP. If you do not enable this, Terrain Holes are not visible in your Scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Transparent Backface**                 || Enable the checkbox to enable support for transparent back-face render passes in HDRP. If your Unity Project does not need to make a transparent back-face pass, disable this checkbox to reduce build time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Transparent Depth Prepass**            || Enable the checkbox to enable support for transparent depth render prepasses in HDRP. If your Unity Project does not need to make a transparent depth prepass, disable this checkbox to reduce build time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Transparent Depth Postpass**           || Enable the checkbox to enable support for transparent depth render postpasses in HDRP. If your Unity Project does not make use of a transparent depth postpass, disable this checkbox to reduce build time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Custom Pass**                          || Enable the checkbox to enable support for [custom passes](Custom-Pass.md) in HDRP. If your Unity Project does not use custom passes, disable this checkbox to save memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| - **Custom Buffer Format**               || Specify the texture format for the custom buffer. If you experience banding issues due to your custom passes, you can change it to either `R11G11B10` if you don't need alpha, or `R16G16B16A16` if you do need alpha.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Light Probe Lighting
Use these settings in the **Quality** > **HDRP** menu to configure [Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes.md).

| **Property** | **Sub-property** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| **Light Probe System** || <ul><li>**Light Probe Groups (Legacy)**: Use the same [Light Probe Group system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LightProbeGroup.html) as the Built-In Render Pipeline.</li><li>**Adaptive Probe Volumes**: Use [Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes.md).</li></ul> |
|| **Memory Budget** | Limits the width and height of the textures that store baked Global Illumination data, which determines the amount of memory Unity sets aside to store baked Adaptive Probe Volume data. These textures have a fixed depth.<br/>Options: <ul><li>**Memory Budget Low**</li><li>**Memory Budget Medium**</li><li>**Memory Budget High**</li></ul> |
|| **SH Bands** | Determines the [spherical harmonics (SH) bands](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes-TechnicalInformation.html) Unity uses to store probe data. L2 provides more precise results, but uses more system resources.<br/>Options: <ul><li>**Spherical Harmonics L1**</li><li>**Spherical Harmonics L2**</li></ul> |
| **Lighting Scenarios** || Enable to use Lighting Scenarios. Refer to [Bake different lighting setups using Lighting Scenarios](probevolumes-bakedifferentlightingsetups.md) for more information. |
|| **Scenario Blending** | Enable blending between different Lighting Scenarios. This uses more memory and makes rendering slower. |
|| **Scenario Blending Memory Budget** | Limits the width and height of the textures that Unity uses to blend between Lighting Scenarios. This determines the amount of memory Unity sets aside to store Lighting Scenario blending data, and store data while doing the blending operation. These textures have a fixed depth. <br/>Options: <br/> &#8226; **Memory Budget Low**<br/> &#8226; **Memory Budget Medium**<br/> &#8226; **Memory Budget High** |
| **Enable GPU Streaming** || Enable to stream Adaptive Probe Volume data from CPU memory to GPU memory at runtime. Refer to [Streaming Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-streaming.md) for more information. |
| **Enable Disk Streaming** || Enable to stream Adaptive Probe Volume data from disk to CPU memory at runtime. [Streaming Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-streaming.md) for more information. |
| **Estimated GPU Memory Cost** || Indicates the amount of texture data used by Adaptive Probe Volumes in your project. This includes textures used both for Global Illumination and Lighting Scenario blending. |

### Cookies

Use the Cookie settings to configure the maximum resolution of the atlas and it's format. A bigger resolution means that you can have more cookies on screen at one time or use bigger cookies texture in general. Increasing for format will allow you to handle HDR cookies and have better precision at the cost of memory.

| **Property**           | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **2D Atlas Size**      | Use the drop-down to select the maximum size for 2D cookie atlas. HDRP uses 2D cookies for Directional, Spot Lights and Area Lights. |
| **2D Atlas Last Valid Mip** | Adds padding to prevent area light cookie border to be cut but can blur the texture a lot if too high values are used. Generally the default value (0) works well in most cases. |
| **Cookie Format** | The format of the cookies that HDRP will use, using R16G16B16A16 instead of R11G11B10 will double the memory usage but help you to avoid banding and adds the support for EXR cookies. |

### Reflections

Use the Reflection settings to configure the max number and resolution of the probes and whether Unity should compress the Reflection Probe cache or not. The Reflection Probe cache is runtime memory that HDRP reserves for Reflection Probes. The cache is a first in, first out list that stores the currently visible Reflection Probes.

| **Property**                             | **Description**                                              |

### Sky

These settings control skybox reflections and skybox lighting.

| **Property**               | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflection Size**        | Use the drop-down to select the maximum resolution of the cube map HDRP uses to manage fallback reflection when no local reflection probes are present. This property has no effect on the quality of the sky itself. |
| **Lighting Override Mask** | Use the drop-down to select the [Volume](understand-volumes.md) layer mask HDRP uses to override sky lighting. Use this to decouple the display sky and lighting. See the [Environment Lighting](Environment-Lighting.md#DecoupleVisualEnvironment) for information on how to decouple environment lighting from the sky background. |

### Shadow

These settings adjust the size of the shadowmask. Smaller values causes Unity to discard more distant shadows, while higher values lead to Unity displaying more shadows at longer distances from the Camera.

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Shadowmask**                  | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP support the [Shadowmask lighting mode](Lighting-Mode-Shadowmask.md) in your Unity Project. |
| **Maximum** **Shadow on Screen** | The maximum number of shadows you can have in view. A Spot Light casts a single shadow, a Point Light casts six shadows, and a Directional Light casts shadows equal to the number of cascades defined in the [HD Shadow Settings](Override-Shadows.md) override. |
| **Punctual Shadow Filtering Quality** | Use the drop-down to select the filtering quality for punctual shadows. A higher shadow quality makes the shadow softer. For information on each filtering quality preset, see the [Filtering Quality](#filtering-quality) table. |
| **Directional Shadow Filtering Quality** | Use the drop-down to select the filtering quality for punctual shadows. A higher shadow quality makes the shadow softer. For information on each filtering quality preset, see the [Filtering Quality](#filtering-quality) table. |
| **Area Shadow Filtering Quality**| Use the drop-down to select the filtering quality for area shadows. Higher values increase the area shadow quality in HDRP as better filtering improves the shape of the penumbra of very soft shadows and reduces light leaking. For information on each area filtering quality preset, see the [Filtering Quality](#filtering-quality) table. |
| **Screen Space Shadows**         | Enable the checkbox to allow HDRP to compute shadows in a separate pass and store them in a screen-aligned Texture. |
| - **Maximum**                    | Set the maximum number of screen space shadows that HDRP can handle. |
| - **Buffer Format**              | Defines the format (R11G11B10 or R16G16B16A16) of the buffer used for screen space shadows.|

The following sections allow you to customize the shadow atlases and individual shadow resolution tiers for each type of Light in HDRP. Shadow resolution tiers are useful because, instead of defining the shadow resolution for each individual Light as a number, you can assign a numbered resolution to a named shadow resolution tier then use the named tier instead of rewriting the number. For example, instead of setting the resolution of each Light to 512, you could say that **Medium** resolution shadows have a resolution of 512 and then set the shadow quality of each Light to be **Medium**. This way, you can more easily have consistent shadow quality across your HDRP Project.

The three sections here are:

- **Directional Light Shadows**
- **Punctual Light Shadows**
- **Area Light Shadows**

They all share the same properties, except **Directional Light Shadows** which does not include **Resolution** or **Dynamic Rescale** and **Cached Shadow Atlas Resolution**.

| **Property**        | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***Light Atlas***   |                                                              |
| **Resolution**      | Use the drop-down to select the resolution of the shadow atlas. |
| **Precision**       | Use the drop-down to select the precision of the shadow map. This sets the bit depth of each pixel of the shadow map. **16 bit** is faster and uses less memory at the expense of precision. |
| **Dynamic Rescale** | Enable the checkbox to allow HDRP to rescale the shadow atlas if all the shadows on the screen don't currently fit onto it. |

| ***Shadow Resolution Tiers***      |                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **L**                              | Set the resolution of shadows set to this quality. Light's with their **Resolution** set to **Low** use this resolution for their shadows. |
| **M**                              | Set the resolution of shadows set to this quality. Light's with their **Resolution** set to **Medium** use this resolution for their shadows. |
| **H**                              | Set the resolution of shadows set to this quality. Light's with their **Resolution** set to **High** use this resolution for their shadows. |
| **U**                              | Set the resolution of shadows set to this quality. Light's with their **Resolution** set to **Ultra** use this resolution for their shadows. |
| **Maximum Shadow Resolution**      | Set the maximum resolution of any shadow map of this Light type. If you set any shadow resolution to a value higher than this, HDRP clamps it to this value. |
| **Cached Shadow Atlas Resolution** | Use the drop-down to select the resolution of the shadow atlas used for cached shadows (Update mode set to OnEnable or OnDemand). |

#### Filtering Quality

| **Punctual Shadow Filtering Quality** | **Algorithm**                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low**                      | Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) 3x3 (4 taps). |
| **Medium**                   | PCF 5x5 (9 taps). |
| **High**                     | Percentage Closer Soft Shadows (PCSS). |

| **Directional Shadow Filtering Quality** | **Algorithm**                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low**                      | PCF Tent 5x5 (9 taps). |
| **Medium**                   | PCF Tent 5x5 (9 taps). |
| **High**                     | PCSS. |

| **Area Shadow Filtering Quality** | **Algorithm**                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Medium**                        | Exponential Variance Shadow Map (EVSM). |
| **High**                          | PCSS. |

The PCF algorithm applies a fixed size blur. PCSS applies a different blur size depending on the distance between the shadowed pixel and the shadow caster. This results in a more realistic shadow that is also more resource intensive to compute.

PCSS: You can change the sample count to decrease the resource intensity of this algorithm, which decreases the quality of these shadows. To change the sample count, set the **Filter Sample Count** and **Blocker Sample Count** in the Inspector of each Light component.

The following factors determine the softness of PCSS shadows:
- Point and Spot Lights: The **Shape** property **Radius**.
- Directional Lights: **Angular Diameter**.
- Area Lights: The position and size of the shadow's near plane, determined by the dimensions of the Light and its **Near Plane** distance setting.

Use **Radius Scale for Softness** or **Angular Diameter Scale for Softness** for additional shadow softness adjustments.

### Lights

Use these settings to enable or disable settings relating to lighting in HDRP.

| **Property**                              | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Maximum Directional On Screen**         | The maximum number of Directional Lights HDRP can manage on screen at once. |
| **Maximum Punctual On Screen**            | The maximum number of [Point and Spot Lights](Glossary.md#PunctualLight) HDRP can manage on screen at once. |
| **Maximum Area On Screen**                | The maximum number of area Lights HDRP can manage on screen at once. |
| **Maximum Lights Per Cell (Ray Tracing)** | The maximum number of Lights that an individual grid cell in a [Light Cluster](Ray-Tracing-Light-Cluster.md) can store. |

## Material

| **Property**                    | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Distortion**                  | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP support distortion. If your Unity Project does not use distortion, disable this checkbox to reduce build time. |
| **Subsurface Scattering**       | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP support subsurface scattering (SSS). SSS describes light penetration of the surface of a translucent object |
| **- High Quality**             | Enable the checkbox to increase the SSS Sample Count and enable high quality subsurface scattering. Increasing the sample count greatly increases the performance cost of the Subsurface Scattering effect. |
| **Fabric BSDF Convolution** | By default, Fabric Materials reuse the Reflection Probes that HDRP calculates for the Lit Shader (GGX BRDF). Enable the checkbox to make HDRP calculate another version of each Reflection Probe for the Fabric Shader, creating more accurate lighting effects. This increases the resource intensity because HDRP must condition two Reflection Probes instead of one. It also reduces the number of visible Reflection Probes in the current view by half because the size of the cache that stores Reflection Probe data does not change and must now store both versions of each Reflection Probe. |

## Post-processing

| **Property**           | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grading LUT Size**   | The size of the internal and external color grading lookup textures (LUTs). This size is fixed for the Project. You can not mix and match LUT sizes, so decide on a size before you start the color grading process. The default value, **32**, provides a good balance of speed and quality. |
| **Grading LUT Format** | Use the drop-down to select the format to encode the color grading LUTs with. Lower precision formats are faster and use less memory at the expense of color precision. These formats directly map to their equivalent in the built-in [GraphicsFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html) enum value. |
| **Buffer Format** |  Use the drop-down to select the format of the color buffers that are used in the post-processing passes. Lower precision formats are faster and use less memory at the expense of color precision. These formats directly map to their equivalent in the built-in [GraphicsFormat](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html) enum value.

## Post-processing Quality Settings
These settings define the quality levels (low, medium, high) related to post processing effects in HDRP. For a detailed description of each setting, see the [Post-processing in HDRP](Post-Processing-Main.md) section of the documentation.

## Virtual Texturing

| **Property**            | **Description**                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU Cache Size**      | Amount of CPU memory (in MB) that can be allocated by the Streaming Virtual Texturing system to cache texture data. |
| **GPU Cache Size per Format** | Amount of GPU memory (in MB) that can be allocated per format by the Streaming Virtual Texturing system to cache texture data. The value assigned to None is used for all unspecified formats. |
| **Preload Textures Per Frame** | The number of textures Unity tries to preload their least detailed mipmap levels (least being 128x128) into GPU memory per frame. Use this to avoid texture pop-in. The range is 0 through 1024. The default is 0, which disables preloading. |
| **Preload Mip Count** | The number of mipmap levels to preload. The range is 1 through 9. The default is 1, which preloads only the highest mipmap level with the smallest size (128x128 pixels, the size of a Streaming Virtual Texturing tile). |
