# Custom Pass reference

## Custom Pass Volume component properties

| **Property**    | **Description**                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mode            | Use the drop-down to select the method that Unity uses to determine whether this Custom Pass Volume can affect a Camera: <br />• **Global**: The Custom Pass Volume has no boundaries, and it can affect every Camera in the scene.<br />• **Local**: Allows you to specify boundaries for the Custom Pass Volume so that it only affects Cameras inside the boundaries. To set the boundaries, add a [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html) to the Custom Pass Volume's GameObject. |
| Injection point | Use the drop-down to define when Unity executes this Custom Pass in the HDRP render loop.<br /><br />For more information about each injection point, see [**Injection Points**](#Injection Points.md) |
| Priority        | If you have more than one Custom Pass Volume assigned to the same injection point, use this property to control the order that Unity executes them in. <br /><br />Unity executes these Volumes in order of Priority, starting with 0. |
| Fade Radius     | Defines when Unity starts to fade in the effect of the Custom Pass as you approach the Volume. <br />A value of 0 means HDRP applies this Volume’s effect immediately at the edge of the Volume. A high value means the effect starts to appear far away from the Volume. <br /><br />This property only appears when **Mode** is set to **Local**. |
| Custom Passes   | Click the Add (**+**) button to create a Custom Pass. The Custom Pass Volume component includes the following types of Custom Passes by default:<br />**• FullScreen Custom Pass**: Use this to execute an effect that Unity applies to the Camera view or stores in the Custom Pass buffer. For more information, see [Full-screen Custom Pass](custom-pass-create-gameobject.md#Full-Screen-Custom-Pass).<br />**• DrawRenderers Custom Pass**: Use this to apply a Custom Pass to GameObjects that are in the Camera view. For more information, see [Draw renderers custom pass](custom-pass-create-gameobject.md#Draw-Renderers-Custom-Pass).<br /><br />• **ObjectID Custom Pass**: Use this to apply a unique color controlled by the Object ID to GameObjects in your scene. For more information, see [Object ID Custom Pass](custom-pass-create-gameobject.md#object-id-custom-pass). <br /><br />If you create your own Custom Pass, it also appears in this drop-down. For more information, see [Scripting your own Custom Pass in C#](Custom-Pass-Scripting.md). <br /><br />If there are one or more Custom Passes in this component, you can click `**-**` to delete one. |

## FullScreenCustomPass properties

Configure a full-screen Custom Pass in the **Custom Passes** panel using the following properties:

| **Property**        | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name                | Use this field to name this Custom Pass. Unity uses this name to refer to this Custom Pass Volume in the [Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html). |
| Target Color Buffer | Select the buffer that Unity writes the color data to: <br/>**Camera:** Targets the current camera color buffer that renders the Custom Pass.<br/>**Custom:** Uses the Custom Pass Buffer allocated in the HDRP asset. <br/>**None:** Doesn’t write the data to a buffer.<br/><br/>You can't write color data to the Camera color buffer if you have **Fetch Color Buffer** enabled.<br/><br/>When the Target Color Buffer and The Target Buffer are both set to **None** Unity does not execute a Custom Pass because there is no buffer to render to. |
| Target Depth Buffer | Select the buffer where Unity writes and tests the depth and stencil data.<br/>This buffer does not contain transparent objects that have **Depth Write** enabled in the [shader properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest?subfolder=/manual/Lit-Shader.html).<br/><br/>When the Target Color Buffer and The Target Buffer are both set to **None** Unity does not execute a Custom Pass because there is no buffer to render to. |
| Clear Flags         | A clear flag discards the contents of a buffer before Unity executes this Custom Pass. <br/>This property assigns a clear flag to one of the following buffers:<br/>**None:** Doesn’t clear any buffers in this pass.<br/>**Color:** Clears the depth buffer.<br/>**Depth:** Clears the depth buffer and the stencil buffer.<br/>**All:** Clears the data in the color, depth, and stencil buffers. |
| Fetch Color Buffer  | Enable this checkbox to allow this Custom Pass to read data from the color buffer. <br/>This applies even when you enable [Multisampling anti-aliasing (MSAA)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest?subfolder=/manual/MSAA.html).<br/><br/>When you enable**Fetch Color Buffer** and MSAA, it forces the color buffer to resolve, and the Custom Pass uses one of the following injection points:<br/>Before PreRefraction<br/>Before Transparent<br/>After Opaque Depth And Normal<br/><br/>A Custom Pass can’t read and write to the same render target. This means that you can’t enable **Fetch Color Buffer** and use **Target Color Buffer** at the same time. |
| FullScreen Material | The material this Custom Pass renders in your scene.         |
| Pass Name           | Select the shader [Pass name](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Pass.html) that Unity uses to draw the full-screen quad. |

## Draw renderers Custom Pass properties

Configure a draw renderers Custom Pass in the **Custom Passes** panel using the following properties:

| Overrides           |                  |             |                                                              |
|                     | Override Mode    |             | Determines what this Custom Pass volume uses to render GameObjects included in this Custom Pass: <br/>&#8226;**Material**<br/>&#8226;**Shader**<br/>&#8226;**Pass Name** |
|                     |                  | Material    | Determines the Material that this Custom Pass uses to override the Material and Material properties of every GameObject included in this Custom Pass.<br/><br/>This property appears when you select the **Material** override mode. <br/>This field accepts an unlit Shader Graph, unlit HDRP Unity shader or lit shader. For a full list of compatible materials, see [Material and injection point compatibility](custom-pass-create-gameobject.md#material-and-injection-point-compatibility).<br/><br/>To create a Unity shader that is compatible with a draw renderers Custom Pass, navigate to **Create > Shader > HDRP > Custom Renderers Pass** . |
|                     |                  | Shader      | Determines the Shader that this Custom Pass uses to override the Materials of every GameObject included in this Custom Pass. <br/><br/>This override keeps all the properties of the original Material and renders them with the Shader you assign.

|                     | Override Depth   |             | Enable this checkbox to override the depth render state in the materials of the rendered GameObjects.<br/><br/> This allows you to replace the default **Depth Test** value, and write the depth using custom values. |
|                     |                  | Depth Test  | When Unity renders a GameObject, it uses the **Depth Test** value to check if it is behind another object. To do this, Unity tests the z-value (the depth) of a given GameObject’s pixel, and compares it against a value stored in the depth buffer. <br/>By default, **Depth Test** is set to **Less Equal**, allowing the original object to appear in front of the object it is tested against. Use the drop-down to select the comparison method to use for the depth test. Each comparison method changes how the Shader renders:<br/><br/>&#8226;**Disabled**: Do not perform a depth test.<br/>&#8226;**Never**: The depth test never passes.<br/>&#8226;**Less**: The depth test passes if the pixel's z-value is less than the stored value.<br/>&#8226;**Equal**: The depth test passes if the pixel's z-value is equal to the stored value.<br/>&#8226;**Less Equa**l: The depth test passes if the pixel's z-value is less than or equal than the Z-buffers value.

This setting only appears when you enable **Override Depth**. |
|                     |                  | Write Depth | Instructs Unity to write depth values for GameObjects that use this material. <br/>Disable it if you do not want Unity to write depth values for each GameObject. |
|                     | Override Stencil |             | Overrides the stencil operations of the Materials in this Custom Pass. Enable this property to control all stencil fields. For more information, see [ShaderLab command: Stencil](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Stencil.html). |
|                     |                  | Reference   | Determines the stencil reference value this Custom Pass uses for all stencil operations. |
|                     |                  | Read mask   | Determines which bits this Custom Pass can read during the stencil test. |
