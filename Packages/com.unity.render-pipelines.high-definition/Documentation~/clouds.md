# Clouds

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) includes two cloud solutions that you can use in your Unity project. You can also create custom cloud effects.

| Page | Description |
|-|-|
| [Understand clouds](understand-clouds.md) | Understand the different ways you can create clouds in HDRP. |
| [Create realistic clouds (volumetric clouds)](create-realistic-clouds-volumetric-clouds.md) | Use a Volumetric Clouds Volume Override to create interactable clouds that can render shadows, and receive fog and volumetric light. |
| [Create simple clouds (Cloud Layer)](create-simple-clouds-cloud-layer.md) | Use a Cloud Layer Volume Override to create a simple representation of clouds using a 2D texture rendered on top of the sky. |
| [Create custom cloud effects](create-custom-cloud-effects.md) | Create your own custom clouds with their own properties and shaders, while still keeping the clouds consistent with HDRP's lighting pipeline. |
| [Troubleshooting Volumetric Clouds rendering issues](troubleshooting-volumetric-clouds-rendering-issues.md) | Prevent far-away clouds from disappearing when the camera moves along the y-axis, especially when traversing the clouds. |
