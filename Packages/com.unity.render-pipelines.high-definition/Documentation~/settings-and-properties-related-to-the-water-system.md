# Settings and properties related to the water system

This page explains the settings and properties you can use to configure the:
* [Water Volume Inspector](#volumeinspector)
* [Water system volume override](#watervoloverride)
* [Water system in the rendering debugger](#waterrenderdebug)
* [Water system in the HDRP asset](#waterhdrpasset)


## Water Volume Inspector
<a name="volumeinspector"></a>

<a name="additionalproperties"></a>

### Additional properties
To see properties related to <b>Fade</b>, <b>Caustics Intensity</b>, and <b>Caustics Plane Band Distance</b>, you must enable them in <b>Preferences</b> > <b>Core Render Pipeline</b>. Select the <b>Visibility</b> option <b>All Visible</b>. These properties are not visible by default because they are not essential to use the feature, being primarily for performance optimization.
