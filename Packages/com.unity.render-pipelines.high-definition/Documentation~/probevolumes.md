# Probe Volumes

Probe Volumes make [Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes.html) easier to use by automating placement. They also provide higher quality, more accurate lighting, because they light per-pixel not per-object.

This feature is experimental, so it's not ready for production use.
