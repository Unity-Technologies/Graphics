# Implement ray tracing with Shader Graph

To use ray-traced effects with Shader Graph, use the **Raytracing Quality** Keyword node. This node exchanges accuracy for speed for ray-traced effects. It's also useful to prevent compilation error due to unsupported nodes when using [Path Tracing](Ray-Tracing-Path-Tracing.md).

## Add the Raytracing Quality Keyword node

The Raytracing Quality Keyword node is a [Built-in Keyword node ](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Keywords.html#built-in-keywords).

To add the Raytracing Quality Keyword node to the graph:

1. In the [Blackboard](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Blackboard.html), click plus (**+**).
2. Go to **Keyword** > **Raytracing Quality**. This creates the keyword and makes it visible on the Blackboard.

## Use the Raytracing Quality keyword node

To use this keyword in the graph, you need to create a [Keyword Node](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Keyword-Node.html). To do this, drag the **Raytracing Quality** Keyword node  from the Blackboard to the graph or open the Create Node Menu and search for **Raytracing Quality** .

| **default**       | Input     | Vector4        | The value to use for the normal Shader Graph. This is the default path Unity uses to render this Shader Graph. |
| **raytraced**     | Input     | Vector4        | The value to use for the fast Shader Graph to use with the ray-traced effects.|
| **pathtraced**    | Input     | Vector4        | The value to use for the Shader Graph when the path tracer is enabled. This is useful to prevent compilation error due to unsupported nodes in path tracing.|
| **output**        | Output    | Vector4        | Outputs is the value which will be selected based on the context this shader graph is used. |
