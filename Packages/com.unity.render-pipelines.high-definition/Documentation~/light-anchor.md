## Anchor a light source

Use the Light Anchor to place light sources around subjects, in relation to a Camera and an anchor point. It's particularly effective for cinematic lighting, which often requires multiple light sources orbiting a subject.

## Create a Light Anchor component

To add a Light Anchor component to a GameObject in your Scene:

1. Select a Light GameObject in the hierarchy to open its Inspector window.
2. Go to **Add Component** > **Rendering** > **Light Anchor**

## Use a Light Anchor component

By default, the Anchor's position is the same as the position of the GameObject the Light Anchor Component is attached to.

**Note**: To use the Light Anchor, you must set the Tag of at least one Camera to "MainCamera".

Use **Orbit** and **Elevation** to control the orientation of the light, in degrees, relative to the main Camera's and Anchor's positions. If the Light has a Cookie or an IES Profile, use **Roll** to change their orientation. Use the **Distance** to control how far from the anchor, in meters, you want to place the Light.

You can use the **Anchor Position Override** to provide a GameObjectâ€™s [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html) as an anchor point for the Light. This is useful if you want the Light to follow a specific GameObject in the Scene.

**Note**: The above example uses the Main Camera as the reference Camera that adjusts the light rotation. The Common presets might create a different result in the Scene View if your view isn't aligned with the Main Camera.

You can set a **Position Offset** for this custom Anchor. This is useful if the Transform position of the custom Anchor isn't centered appropriately for the light to orbit correctly around the custom Anchor.


The Light Anchor component also includes a list of **Presets** that you can use to set the Light's orientation relative to the main Camera. To learn more about light anchor properties, refer to [Light Anchor reference](reference-light-anchor.md).
