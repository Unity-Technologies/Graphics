# Sky

Create different types of sky in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).

**Note**: Procedural sky is deprecated and no longer built into HDRP. For information on how to add Procedural Sky to your HDRP Project, see the [Upgrading from 2019.2 to 2019.3 guide](Upgrading-From-2019.2-to-2019.3.md#ProceduralSky).

| Page | Description |
|-|-|
| [Understand sky](understand-sky.md) | Understand the different ways you can create sky in HDRP. |
| [Set the type of sky](set-the-type-of-sky.md) | Use a Visual Environment Volume Override to change the type of sky HDRP uses, and configure the sky and clouds. |
| [Create a gradient sky](create-a-gradient-sky.md) | Use a Gradient Sky Volume Override to create a simple sky where HDRP interpolates between three colors. |
| [Create an HDRI sky](create-an-hdri-sky.md) | Use an HDRI Sky Volume Override to create a simple sky that uses a cubemap texture. |
| [Create a physically based sky](create-a-physically-based-sky.md) | Use a Physically Based Sky Volume Override to create a sky that simulates a spherical planet with a two-part atmosphere that has an exponentially decreasing density based on its altitude. |
| [Create a custom sky effect](create-a-custom-sky.md) | Develop your own custom sky with its own properties and shaders, while still keeping the sky consistent with the lighting pipeline. |
