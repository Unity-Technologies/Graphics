# Simulate ripples with masks

A simulation mask defines areas of influence for specific water simulation effects, such as ripples.

By using a simulation mask, you can attenuate specific frequencies in specific regions.

For example, if you're simulating debris or objects affecting the water, a simulation mask will allow you to attenuate waves at specific places based on those interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> For backward compatibility, simulation masks are disabled by default.
