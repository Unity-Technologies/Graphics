## Properties

### Surface Options

View and edit these properties to affect the attributes of the material the decal is projected onto when HDRP renders it into the scene.

| **Property**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Affect BaseColor**         | Enable the checkbox to make this decal use the **baseColor** properties. Otherwise the decal has no baseColor effect. Regardless of whether you enable or disable this property, HDRP still uses the alpha channel of the base color as an opacity for the other properties.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces.                                                                                            |
| **Affect Normal**            | Enable the checkbox to make the decal use the **normal** property. Otherwise, the decal does not modify the normals of the receiving Material.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Affect Metal**             | Enable the checkbox to make the decal use the metallic property of its **Mask Map**. Otherwise the decal has no metallic effect. Uses the red channel of the **Mask Map**.<br/><br/>This property only appears when you enable the **Metal and Ambient Occlusion properties** checkbox in your [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md#Decals).<br/><br/>Applies to opaque surfaces only.                                                      |
| **Affect Ambient Occlusion** | Enable the checkbox to make the decal use the ambient occlusion property of its **Mask Map**. Otherwise the decal has no ambient occlusion effect. Uses the green channel of the **Mask Map**.<br/><br/>This property only appears when you enable the **Metal and Ambient Occlusion properties** checkbox in your [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md#Decals).<br/><br/>Applies to opaque surfaces only.                                  |
| **Affect Smoothness**        | Enable the checkbox to make the decal use the smoothness property of its **Mask Map**. Otherwise the decal has no smoothness effect. Uses the alpha channel of the **Mask Map**.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Affect Emissive**          | Enable the checkbox to make this decal emissive. When enabled, this Material appears self-illuminated and acts as a visible source of light. This property does not work with transparent receiving Materials. Emissive decals always give an additive positive contribution. This property does not affect the existing emissive properties of the Materials assigned to a GameObject.<br/><br/>Applies to opaque surfaces only. |

| **Draw Order**            | Controls the order in which HDRP draws decals in the Scene. HDRP draws decals with lower values first, so it draws decals with a higher draw order value on top of those with lower values. This feature works for decals projected on opaque and transparent surfaces. Additionally, if you have multiple Decal Materials with the same **Draw Order**, the order HDRP renders them in depends on the order you create the Materials. HDRP renders Decal Materials you create first before those you create later with the same **Draw Order**, or Materials that you load first from an AssetBundle.<br/><br/>To control the order of Mesh decals using the same Material, you should set the priority value on the MeshRenderer of the Mesh decals.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces. |
| **Mesh Decal Bias Type**  | Determines the type of bias that HDRP applies to the decal’s Mesh to stop it from overlapping with other Meshes. The options are:<br/><br/>&#8226; **Depth Bias**: Applies a bias to the final depth value,<br/><br/>&#8226; **View Bias**: Applies a world-space bias (in meters) alongside the view vector.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Mesh Decal View Bias**  | A world-space bias (in meters) that HDRP applies to the decal’s Mesh to stop it from overlapping with other Meshes along the view vector. A positive value draws the decal in front of any overlapping Mesh, while a negative value offsets the decal and draws it behind. This property only affects decal Materials directly attached to GameObjects with a Mesh Renderer, so Decal Projectors do not use this property. This property is only visible if **Mesh Decal Bias Type** is set to **View Bias**.<br/><br/>Applies to both opaque and transparent surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Mesh Decal Depth Bias** | A depth bias that HDRP applies to the decal’s Mesh to stop it from overlapping with other Meshes. A negative value draws the decal in front of any overlapping Mesh, while a positive value offsets the decal and draw it behind. This property only affects decal Materials directly attached to GameObjects with a Mesh Renderer, so Decal Projectors do not use this property.

### HDRP Asset properties

You can edit global settings that apply to all decals in your Scene in your Unity Project’s HDRP Asset. For information on these properties, refer to the [**Decals** section of the HDRP Asset documentation](HDRP-Asset.md#Decals).
