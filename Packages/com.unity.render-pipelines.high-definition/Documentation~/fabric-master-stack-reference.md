# Fabric Master Stack reference

You can modify the properties of a Fabric Shader Graph in the Fabric Master Stack.

Refer to [Fabrics](fabrics.md) for more information.

## Contexts

[!include[](snippets/master-stacks-contexts-intro.md)]

### Vertex Context

#### Default

When you create a new Fabric Master Stack, the Vertex Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>

[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-position.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-normal.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/vertex-tangent.md)]

</table>

#### Relevant

Depending on the [Graph Settings](#graph-settings) you use, Shader Graph can add the following Blocks to the Vertex Context:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>

[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/tessellation-factor.md)]
[!include[](snippets/shader-graph-blocks/tessellation-displacement.md)]

</table>

### Fragment Context

#### Default

When you create a new Fabric Master Stack, the Fragment Context contains the following Blocks by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Setting Dependency</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
