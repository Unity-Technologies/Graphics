# Water surface fluctuations

You can apply effects like swell, agitation, and deformation across the water surface.

You can add fluctuations such as swell, agitation, or ripples to the whole of a water surface based on texture channels with a simulation mask.

You can also add detailed visual effects to localized water areas with water decals, a type of shader graph nodes.
