| **Cloud Control**                 | Specifies the mode to control volumetric cloud properties. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Simple**: Uses sliders and input fields to customize volumetric cloud shape properties. This mode generates a cloud map from the various properties and uses HDRP's internal cloud lookup table.<br/>&#8226; **Advanced**: Uses separate Textures to specify each cloud type and their coverage. This mode generates a cloud map from the various Textures and uses HDRP's internal cloud lookup table.<br/>&#8226; **Manual**: Uses the cloud map and lookup table you supply to render the clouds. For more information on the cloud map and cloud lookup table, see [Cloud map and cloud lookup table](#cloud-map-and-cloud-lookup-table). |

### Quality

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Temporal Accumulation Factor** | The amount of temporal accumulation to apply to the clouds. Temporal accumulation increases the visual quality of clouds by decreasing the noise. A higher value produces better quality clouds, but can create [ghosting](Glossary.md#ghosting). |
| **Ghosting Reduction**           | When you enable this property, HDRP removes the ghosting caused by temporal accumulation. This effect might cause a flickering effect when the **Temporal Accumulation Factor** value is low. |
| **Perceptual Blending**          | Blend the clouds with the environment. This might cause artifacts if the sky is overexposed. This setting only has an effect when you disable multi-sample antialiasing (MSAA). |
| **Num Primary Steps**            | The number of steps to use to evaluate the clouds' transmittance. Higher values linearly increase the resource intensity of the effect. |
| **Num Light Steps**              | The number of steps to use to evaluate the clouds' lighting. Higher values exponent increase the resource intensity of the effect. |

### Lighting

| **Property**                   | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ambient Light Probe Dimmer** | Controls the influence of light probes on the cloud volume. A lower value suppresses the ambient light and produces darker clouds overall. |
| **Sun Light Dimmer**           | Controls the influence of the sun light on the cloud volume. A lower value suppresses the sun light and produces darker clouds overall. |
| **Erosion Occlusion**          | Controls how much Erosion Factor is taken into account when computing ambient occlusion. The Erosion Factor parameter is editable in the custom preset, Advanced and Manual Modes. |
| **Scattering Tint**            | The color to tint the clouds.                                |
| **Powder Effect Intensity**    | Controls the amount of local scattering in the clouds. When clouds have a lot of local details due to erosion, a value of **1** provides a more powdery aspect. |
| **Multi Scattering**           | Controls the amount of multi-scattering inside the cloud. Higher values make lighting look more diffuse within the cloud. |

### Shadows

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Shadows**                      | When enabled, HDRP evaluates the Volumetric Clouds' shadows. The Volumetric Clouds shadow is rendered independently of the shadow map toggle of the directional [Light](Light-Component.md). |
| - **Shadow Resolution**          | Specifies the resolution of the volumetric clouds shadow map. |
| - **Shadow Distance**            | The size of the area to render volumetric cloud shadows around the camera. |
| - **Shadow Opacity**             | The opacity of the volumetric cloud shadows.                 |
| - **Shadow Opacity Fallback**    | Controls the shadow opacity when outside the area covered by the volumetric clouds shadow. |

### Cloud map and cloud lookup table

The **Cloud Map** and **Clout LUT** Textures define the shape and look of volumetric clouds. Both of these Textures are [channel-packed](Glossary.md#channel-packing) where each channel contains a separate grayscale Texture with a specific purpose. These two maps are not trivial to author, so it is best to only set **Cloud Control** to **Manual** if your project requires very specific clouds and you can use tool assistance to generate the maps.

For the **Cloud Map**, the color channels represent:

* **Red**: Coverage. Specifies the density of the clouds across the Texture.
    * Values closer to **0** represent an area of the clouds less affected by noise.
    * values closer to **1** represent an area of the clouds more affected by noise.

* **Green**: Rain. Specifies the areas of the clouds that are lighter/darker.
    * Values closer to **0** represent an area of the clouds with less rain that are lighter in color.
    * Values closer to **1** represent an area of the clouds with more rain that are darker in color.
* **Blue**: Type. Maps along the cloud lookup table's horizontal axis to specify cloud properties at the world position the texel Texture represents.

For the **Cloud LUT**, the color channels represent:

* **Red**: Profile Coverage. Determines the density of the cloud based on its height within the cloud volume.
* **Green**: Erosion and shaping. Determines which areas of the cloud volume are more susceptible to erosion and shaping. Values closer to 1 mean the cloud is more susceptible to erosion and shaping.
* **Blue**: Ambient Occlusion. A multiplier that HDRP applies to the ambient probe when it calculates lighting for the volumetric clouds.

When importing these two map Textures, disable **sRGB**. For best results, do not use any compression.

![A small rectangular texture with a bright cyan background. On the left are two small white clouds at different heights. On the right is a curving gradient from red to green.](Images/CloudLUT_Advanced.png)<br/>
As a reference, here is the procedurally generated cloud LUT used for advanced mode. You can clearly see the 3 types of clouds (mid-altitude on the left, high altitude in the middle and cumulonimbus on the right).
Also, there is variations in the green and blue channels to specify more of less erosion and ambient occlusion depending on the cloud profile. 

![A rectangular texture with 8 bands of 32 pixels each. The first 3 bands are thin clouds at different heights. The next band is a tall fluffy cloud. The next 3 bands are clouds that get spottier at different heights. The final band is a curving vertical cloud. The edge at 96 pixels maps to the top-left of the sky, and the edge at 128 pixels maps to the center of the sky. The final image is a tower of layered cloud, with smaller clouds scattered nearby.)](Images/Volumetric-Clouds-manual-lut.png)

Here is an example cloud LUT that can be used in manual mode. On the top image, the LUT is divided into 8 32px wide parts, each representing a cloud type with a specific profile and altitude. (stratus on the left and cumulus on the right)
On the bottom left, the cloud map uses grayscale values to map which type of clouds is used. For exemple a radial gradient using thoses values creates a circular cloud as seen on the bottom right using the profile set on the cloud LUT.  
For more examples, you can get the [environment samples](HDRP-Sample-Content.html#environment-samples) from the package manager.   

**Note**: This cloud map is formatted differently to the cloud map that the [Cloud Layer](create-simple-clouds-cloud-layer.md) feature uses.
