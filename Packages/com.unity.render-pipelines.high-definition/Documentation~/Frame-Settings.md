# Frame Settings

Frame Settings are settings HDRP uses to render Cameras, real-time, baked, and custom reflections. You can set the default values for Frame Settings for each of these three individually from within the [HDRP Global Settings](Default-Settings-Window.md) tab (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Graphics** > **HDRP Global Settings**).

![](Images/FrameSettings1.png)

To make Cameras and Reflection Probes use their respective default values for Frame Settings, disable the **Custom Frame Settings** checkbox under the **General** settings of Cameras or under **Capture Settings** of Reflection Probes.

You can override the default value of a Frame Setting on a per component basis. Enable the **Custom Frame Settings** checkbox to set specific Frame Settings for individual Cameras and Reflection Probes. This exposes the Frame Settings Override which gives you access to the same settings as within the HDRP Global Settings. Edit the settings within the Frame Settings Override to create a Frame Settings profile for an individual component.

**Note**: Baked Reflection Probes use the Frame Settings at baking time only. After that, HDRP uses the baked texture without modifying it with updated Frame Settings.

**Note**: If [Virtual Texturing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/svt-streaming-virtual-texturing.html) is disabled in your project, the **Virtual Texturing** setting is grayed out.

Frame Settings affect all Cameras and Reflection Probes. HDRP handles Reflection Probes in the same way it does Cameras, this includes Frame Settings. All Cameras and Reflection Probes either use the default Frame Settings or a Frame Settings Override to render the Scene.

## Properties

Frame Settings all include the following properties:

### Rendering

These settings determine the method that the Cameras and Reflection Probes using these Frame Settings use for their rendering passes. You can control properties such as the rendering method, whether to use MSAA, or even whether the Camera renders opaque Materials at all. Disabling these settings doesn't save on memory, but can improve performance.

### Light Loop Debug

Use these settings to enable or disable settings relating to lighting in HDRP.

**Note**: These settings are for debugging purposes only. Each property here describes an optimization so disabling any of them has a negative impact on performance. You should only disable an optimization to isolate issues for debugging.

| **Property**                  | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FPTL For Forward Opaque**   | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP use Fine Pruned Tiled Lighting for Forward rendered opaque GameObjects. |
| **Big Tile Prepass**          | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP use an optimization using a prepass with bigger tiles for tile lighting computation. |
| **Deferred Tile**             | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP use tiles to calculate deferred lighting. Disable this checkbox to use a full-screen brute force pixel Shader instead. |
| **Compute Light Evaluation**  | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP compute lighting using a compute Shader and tile classification. Otherwise HDRP uses a generic pixel Shader. |
| **Compute Light Variants**    | Enable the checkbox to classify tiles by light type combinations. Enable Compute Light Evaluation to access this property. |
| **Compute Material Variants** | Enable the checkbox to classify tiles by Material variant combinations. Enable Compute Light Evaluation to access this property. |

## Debugging Frame Settings

You can use the [Rendering Debugger](Render-Pipeline-Debug-Window.md) to temporarily change Frame Settings for a Camera without altering the actual Frame Settings data of the Camera itself. This means that, when you stop debugging, the Frame Settings for the Camera are as you set them before you started debugging.
