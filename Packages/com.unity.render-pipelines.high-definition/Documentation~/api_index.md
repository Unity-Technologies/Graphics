# High Definition Render Pipeline scripting API

This is the documentation for the scripting APIs of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) package.

**Note**: HDRP is built on the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Core package and uses some class types that you can only find in the [SRP Core scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@17.0/api/index.html).
