and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.2.1] - 2022-01-12

### Fixed
- Fixed missing XR warnings for XR non-friendly effects when using XR plugins (case 1328062)
- Fixed rendering artifacts when depth buffer is used after screen space reflections pass on iOS and M1 (case 1341052)
- Fixed compilation error when built-in VR module is disabled (case 1389160)
- Fixed bug where alpha could not be used with HDR on mobile (case 1387848). HDR texture format is now set from Graphics Tier Settings when using Unity 2019.3 or newer.
- Fixed incorrect Screen-space Reflections rendering on OpenGL platforms (case 1368370)

## [3.2.0] - 2021-11-15

### Fixed
- Catch thrown errors in `PostProcessEffectRenderer`, preventing resources allocation leaks and crash (case 1221972)
- Fixed error thrown when changing post process layer right after creation or before destruction.
- Fix FXAA when render-target has no alpha channel (case 1344618) (case 1351502)

## [3.1.1] - 2021-03-08

### Fixed
- Fix for broken MSVO on desktop platforms.
- Fix for compilation issue with BuildTarget error on XboxOne platform.

## [3.1.0] - 2021-03-02

### Added
- Support for the PlayStation 5 platform has been added.
- Support for the XboxSeries platform has been added.

### Fixed
- Fix for issue thrown upon unloading a scene from an AssetBundle (case 1262826)
- Fix for MSVO when used with dynamic resolution reallocating temporary render targets whenever the dynamic resolution scale was changed which could cause a higher peak VRAM usage and fragmentation (Case 1285605). Temporary targets will now use dynamic scaling as well to solve this. Please note there is a bug in Unity that breaks this fix (case 1285577) To make use of dynamic resolution and MSVO please use Unity 2019.4.19f1, 2020.2.2f1, 2021.1.0a9 or later.
