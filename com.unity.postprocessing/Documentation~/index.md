## Post Processing Stack v2 overview

Post-processing is a generic term for a full-screen image processing effect that occurs after the camera draws the scene but before the scene is rendered on the screen. Post-processing can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.

For information about requirements and compatibility, see section [Requirements](requirements.html).

The images below demonstrate a scene with and without post-processing:
