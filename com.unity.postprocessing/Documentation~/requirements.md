> [!WARNING]
> Built-In Render Pipeline (BiRP) support for the Post Processing package is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

## Unity Player system requirements

This package does not add any platform-specific requirements to Unity. For more information on Unity system requirements, see [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html).

Some **Post Processing** effects have extra requirements in addition to the common Unity Player system requirements. For system requirements for each effect, see the specific effect page.
