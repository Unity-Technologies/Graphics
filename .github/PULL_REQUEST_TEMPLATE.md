## **PR Workflow for the Graphics repository:**
* **All PRs must be opened as draft initially**
* Reviewers can be added while the PR is still in draft
* The PR can be marked as “Ready for Review” once the reviewers have confirmed that **no more changes are needed**
* Tests will start automatically after the PR is marked as “Ready for Review”
* **Do not use [skip ci]** - this can break some of our tooling
