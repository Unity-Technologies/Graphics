## **PR Workflow for the Graphics repository:**
* **All PRs must be opened as draft initially**
* Reviewers can be added while the PR is still in draft
* The PR can be marked as “Ready for Review” once the reviewers have confirmed that **no more changes are needed**
* Tests will start automatically after the PR is marked as “Ready for Review”
* **Do not use [skip ci]** - this can break some of our tooling
* Read the [Graphics repository & Yamato FAQ](http://go/graphics-yamato-faq).

### Checklist for PR maker
- [ ] Have you added a backport label (if needed)? For example, the `need-backport-*` label. After you backport the PR, the label changes to `backported-*`.
- [ ] Have you updated the changelog? Each package has a `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- [ ] Have you updated or added the documentation for your PR? When you add a new feature, change a property name, or change the behavior of a feature, it's best practice to include related documentation changes in the same PR. If you do add documentation, make sure to add the relevant Graphics Docs team member as a reviewer of the PR. If you are not sure which person to add, see the [Docs team contacts sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgUWWgwLFEHIQ3Rz-LnK6PAKmbM49DZZ9al4hvnztOo/edit#gid=1058860420).
- [ ] Have you added a graphic test for your PR (if needed)? When you add a new feature, or discover a bug that tests don't cover, please add a graphic test.
