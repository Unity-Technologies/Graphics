        m_Untranslated: Baking settings
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "In the Lighting window, you can see all of the baking settings,
          they can be stored into a <b>Lighting Settings</b> asset.\r\n\r\nWe offer
          4 different assets in this template, with different levels of quality,
          which will have a direct impact on how long the bake will take: the higher
          the quality, the longer the bake. \r\n\r\nThese presets can be found in
          the project under <b>Assets->Scenes->SampleScene</b>. The easy way to locate
          them is to simply click on the Lighting Settings field in the Lighting
          tab.\r\n\r\nInspect each preset starting with <b>Lighting Settings Draft</b>
          up to <b>Lighting Settings Ultra</b>. Important settings to take note of:\r\n\r\n*
          <b>Lightmap Resolution</b> - controls how precise the lightmap is. Higher
          number means larger file size, slower bake, increased maximum quality.\r\n\r\n* 
          <b>Indirect and Environment samples</b> - controls how grainy or smooth
          the lighting will be. While resolution limits the max quality, the sample
          count is used to reach that maximum. Meaning if the lightmap resolution
          is low and we keep increasing sample count, the quality will not get any
          better. No effect on file size.\r\n\r\n* <b>Direct samples</b> - controls
          the quality of direct shadows. Not used in this demo, since all shadows
          are realtime. We have set different values for convenience if users want
          to switch to fully baked lighting and shadows.\r\n\r\n*<b>Max bounces and
          Min bounces</b> - controls how many times the light ray can bounce. A higher
          number brings more realism but increases baking time. \r\n\r\n* <b>Filtering</b>
          - is a complex subject, but the key takeaway is that most of the time using
          Filtering is a good idea. It will allow you to have faster bake times without
          a major impact on quality. Which method to use can depend on a case by
          case scenario, but often Optix can work better with lower sample counts
          and Open Image for higher.\r"
