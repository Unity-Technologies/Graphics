        m_Untranslated: Explore light probes
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Let\u2019s take a look at how light probes were set up for
          this scene.\r\n\r\nTip: If you'd like to match the image above, make sure
          Gizmos are on, light probes are not selected and at the bottom of the Lighting
          window, set Light Probe Visualization to <b>All probes no cells</b>.\r\n\r\nAll
          the scene light probes can be found in <i>Hierarchy</i> window <b>Lighting->Light
          Probe Group</b>. They were placed by hand, if you'd select Light Probe
          Group and in the <i>Inspector</i> click <b>Edit Light Probes</b> button,
          you could select, move or add new ones. \r\n\r\nWe will not cover how to
          manually place or create them since there is nothing HDRP specific, however,
          will highlight a few key points to have in mind:\r\n\r\n* Light probes
          are not realtime, remember to rebake if you made drastic changes to lighting.\r\n\r\n*
          Spheres in the image above show at what points in the scene lighting data
          will be sampled. Whenever an object is set to receive lighting from light
          probes(default), the object will receive the lighting using a blend from
          the 4 closest probes. So it is important to place probes where a drastic
          lighting change is occurring, for example in a shadow and next to it.\r\n\r\n*
          Even if an object will not move, it doesn\u2019t mean it should be marked
          as static and use lightmaps. Using light probes instead, even for stationary
          objects, will reduce baking times and lightmap sizes a lot. For example,
          see the chairs in the 3rd room. They are only static for reflections and
          receive lighting from probes. Generally, small objects should use light
          probes, not baked lightmaps.\r\n"
