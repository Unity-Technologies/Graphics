      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "I would like to highlight one specific use case of light
          probes in this project. Remember in the previous step we talked about not
          setting small objects as static, to save lightmap space and reduce bake
          times. Well if you would select objects in the tree cage, you could see
          that we are doing what we just said not to do. Why?\r\n\r\n1) In the <i>Hierarchy</i>
          windows search bar type in LOD00. Bamboo trees and rocks should be filtered
          out\r\n2) Select any of these objects and notice in the <i>Inspector</i>
          window, they are marked as static\r\n\r\nUsually, if an object is marked
          static it will reserve space in the baked lightmap, will take longer to
          bake. If it\u2019s not marked as static, the light baking and probe baking
          process will just ignore the object as if it doesn\u2019t exist. \r\n\r\nIn
          this specific scenario, we have a lot of small objects together forming
          a large enough group so it would impact traveling light within the scene.
          In situations like these, we can mark the bamboo trees as static, but in
          the inspector window under Lighting->Recveive Global Illumination set Light
          Probes. This way trees will still receive lighting from light probes, but
          will no longer be invisible to the baking system, allowing them to contribute
          to indirect lighting.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the image above, more specifically
          at the wall right to the cage. Just above the line, you should notice a
          slight green tint, representing light rays passing through leaves and hitting
          the wall. The effect is subtle, but realistic graphics are mostly composed
          of a lot of small details forming a greater picture.\r\n\r\nWhile it could
          be a lot to take in, simply remember that large groups of small objects
          could benefit from being static + receiving GI from light probes. See <a
          href=\"https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/08/28/static-lighting-with-light-probes/\">here</a>
          for more info about this use case.\r\n"
