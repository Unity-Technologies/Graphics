      m_Summary: Baking settings
      m_Description: "In the Lighting window you can see all of the baking settings,
        they can be stored into a <b>Lighting Settings</b> asset.\n\nWe offer 4 different
        assets in this template, with different levels of quality, which will have
        a direct impact on how long the bake will take: the higher the quality, the
        longer the bake. \n\nThese presets can be found in the project under <b>Assets->Scenes->SampleScene</b>.
        Easy way to locate them is to simply click on Lighting Settings field in
        Lighting tab.\n\nInspect each preset starting with <b>Lighting Settings Draft</b>
        up to <b>Lighting Settings Ultra</b>. Important settings to take note of:\n\n*
        <b>Lightmap Resolution</b> - controls how precise the lightmap is. Higher
        number means larger file size, slower bake, increased maximum quality.\n\n* 
        <b>Indirect and Environment samples</b> - controls how grainy or smooth the
        lighting will be. While resolution limits the max quality, samples count
        is used to reach that maximum. Meaning if if lightmap resolution is low and
        we keep increasing sample count, the quality will not get any better. No
        effect on file size.\n\n* <b>Direct samples</b> - controls the quality of
        direct shadows. Not used in this demo, since all shadows are realtime. We
        have set different values for convenience if users want to switch to fully
        baked lighting and shadows.\n\n*<b>Max bounces and Min bounces</b> - controls
        how many times the light ray can bounce. Higher number brings more realism
        but increases baked time. \n\n* <b>Filtering</b> - is a complex subject,
        but the key takeway is that most of the time using Filtering is a good idea.
        It will allow you to have faster bake times without a major impact to quality.
        Which method to use can depend on case by case scenario, but often Optix
        can work better with lower sample counts and Open Image for higher."
