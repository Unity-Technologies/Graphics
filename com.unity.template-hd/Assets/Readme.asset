  title: High-Definition Render Pipeline
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: This template is a good starting point for projects aiming at <b>High-end Graphics</b>
      and developed for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11
      and above). This template utilizes the <b>High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)</b>,
      a modern rendering pipeline that includes advanced material types and a configurable
      hybrid tile/cluster deferred/forward lighting architecture. This template also includes the <b>Shader Graph</b> tool, <b>Visual Effect Graph</b> tool, several Presets to jump start development, and example content.
