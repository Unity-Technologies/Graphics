# Purpose
This script generates Yamato job definition files based on configuration/metafiles, making it easier to change the Yamato jobs by (usually) only editing these metafiles.
- Pros:
   - no manual editing means less linter errors, path mismatches etc
   - consistency among all files
   - easy to track changes to .yml files with git diff, since they are in their final form 
   - reduced code duplication and possibility define constants in a single place
- Cons:
   - the higher consistency among files and the reduced code duplication makes introducing exceptions more difficult

# Structure
- *.yamato/config/* - directory containing configurations (metafiles) for the jobs to be generated, this is where most of the changes to Yamato jobs should be introduced (Input)
- *.yamato/*  - directory containing all the generated job definition files (.yml) (Output)
- *.yamato/ruamel/build.py* - main script, which creates the actual yml files
- *.yamato/ruamel/metafile_parser.py* - helper script to read the metafiles and retrieve according information and/or override keys from ___shared.metafile
- *.yamato/ruamel/jobs/* - directory containing all Python modules for the jobs to be generated, which are organized into subdirectories by domains

# Running the script
Script must be run again each time new changes are introduced in the metafiles.
- Install ruamel by `pip install ruamel.yaml` (or `pip3`)
- Run script inside *ruamel/* directory by `python build.py` (or `python3`)

# Example use cases
The majority of changes are introduced within metafiles (*.yamato/config/\*.metafile*, for details check metafile descriptions below). After introducing changes, the script must be rerun (to clean up current jobs, and fetch the updated metafiles to recreate the jobs)

### ABV related changes (_abv.metafile)
- Add a new project to ABV: add the project name (the one used inside the projectâ€™s own metafile, e.g. Universal) under abv.projects 
- Add a new job to Nightly: add the dependency under nightly.extra_dependencies (these dependencies run in addition to ABV)
- Add job to trunk verification: add the dependency under trunk_verification.dependencies

### Project related changes (project_name.metafile)
- Adding a new job to All_{project_name}: add the new job under all.dependencies (this job can also be from a different project) 
- Adding a new platform/api for the project: extend the list under platforms as indicated
- Creating a new project: create a new metafile same way as is done for existing projects. All ymls get created once the script runs
- Use different agent than what is specified in the shared metafile: override the agent as described in the metafile description under platforms section

### Package related changes (_packages.metafile)
- Adding a new package: extend packages list with new package details. The new package jobs get automatically created once the script runs (pack, publish, test, test_dependencies). The package is also automatically included in test_all and publish_all jobs.


### Changes when branching out
- When branching out (e.g. moving from *master* to *9.x.x/release* branch), the following steps must be done:
  - In *__shared.metafile* :
    - Change `editors` section to contain the correct editors
    - Change `target_editor` to the target editor track for this branch (this is used e.g. for dependencies of *packages#publish_*, *preview_publish#publish_*  and *preview_publish#wait_for_nightly*) (e.g. for 9.x.x this would correspond to `2020.1`)
    - Change `target_branch` to the current branch (this is used for ci triggers, such as ABV  (*all_project_ci*) jobs) (e.g. for 9.x.x this would correspond to `9.x.x/release`)
    - Change `target_branch_editor_ci` to the correct ci branch (editor pinning branch)
  - In *__editor.metafile*:
    - Change `editor_tracks` to correct track (trunk, 2020.1, etc)
  - In *_packages.metafile*:
    - Change `publish_all_track` to correct track (trunk, 2020.1, etc), on which package publish job depends on. This track is also used for setting a separate PR trigger on all package CI job (but it is currently commented out/disabled, as it is already covered by ABV).

### If trunk track changes:
  - Change `trunk_track` in `_editor.metafile`

### Custom test platforms:
- There are 3 base test platforms to choose from: standalone (build), playmode, editmode. These can be extended by renaming them, and/or adding additional utr on top of existing ones. Their corresponding base UTR flags are found in `ruamel/jobs/shared/utr_utils.py`
- If name not specified, name it set to type. Name is used for creating Yamato job ids and excluding testplatforms. If setting up e.g. two playmode types with different flags, renaming must be used, otherwise (due to matching job id) one job overrides the other.
- If a specific platform requires flags different from what is marked in `utr_utils.py`, they are to be configured in the corresponding platform cmd file. Either _a)_ override flag value with the optional parameters _b)_ cancel the flag by overriding with `None` (make sure the function expects such value for such flag though), or _c)_ append additional platform specific flags to the utr_flags list 
- Exclude testplatforms for platforms by specifying the testplatform NAME (not type) in `__shared.metafile`
- Example: extending the default playmode for a specific project performance tests (this takes base playmode flags, and appends these for all platforms, unless specified otherwise in platform cmd file.) Note: when adding extra args to a standalone job, build flags can be specified separately by `extra_utr_flags_build` (scroll down to see project metafile docs)
  ```
    - type: playmode
      name: playmode_perf_build
      extra_utr_flags:
        - --scripting-backend=il2cpp
        - --timeout=1200
        - --performance-project-id=URP_Performance
        - --testfilter=Build
        - --suite=Editor
  ```
  If this platform should not be included eg for IPhone, then specify it in `__shared.metafile` like
  ```
  iPhone:
    name: iPhone
    os: ios
    apis:
      - name: Metal
        exclude_test_platforms:
        - editmode
        - ...
        - playmode_perf_build
  ```

        - playmode_perf_build
  ```


### Other changes to metafiles
- All files follow a similar structure and changes can be done according to the metafile descriptions given below. 

### Changes within Python
- Creating a new job: 
    - Create a new job file under a domain/, same way as existing jobs are defined. 
    - Each domain subdirectory contains a file *yml_domain.py* with a function that loops over everything defined in a metafile, and stores all the created yml jobs for this domain, and then returns a dictionary with *(key,value)* pairs of *(file_path,yml_content)* respectively. Add the newly created job into this function and make sure it is included in this dictionary with its filepath as the key.
    - When the script runs, it will dump the new job along with the rest of the jobs in this dictionary into their respective files.
- Changing constants, variables, paths, ids, etc: all changes should be introduced in either shared/namer.py or shared/constants.py
- Extending the YAMLJob building block class: if new functionality is needed, e.g. a new section under any job file is needed, define it as a function under shared/yml_job.py class.
- Changing to using split test/build for Standalone: under jobs/projects/commands/_cmd_mapper.py change the reference to which set of commands to use. For instance, to switch from Linux to Linux split, change under linux section all linux.cmd_* to linux_split.cmd_*. This simply uses the different set of commands, and the project job definition will automatically create split test/build if split commandset is used, and vice versa.

#### Python structure explanation for projects
- Project jobs are defined by 3 job definition files: **standalone** (contains standalone_build job if split commandset is used), **standalone_build** (build job for standalone tests), **not_standalone** (editmode, playmode, playmode_xr)
- Because all jobs follow the same structure no matter which platform/api is used, with only the commands (and the agent) being different, then commands are obtained from files under jobs/projects/commands/{platform}.py by the job definition class. 
    - Each of these files has commands specific to its platform. If commands differ also per api, like for OSX, then {platform}_{api}.py format is used. 
    - Each of these files contains functions for 3 commandsets (for standalone, standalone_build, not_standalone), which are then used according to which job is being created. 
    - The mapping of which commands to use for which platform is done under _cmd_mapper.py. This also makes it easy to switch the set of commands for a specific platform, such as to switch to new split built/test, without completely losing the old solution.

## Editor priming vs editor pinning
- Editor priming:
    - Gets the editor in a separate job to save on the compute resources, stores the editor version in a .txt file which is then picked up by the parent job which calls unity-downloader-cli
    - Still used for custom-revision jobs, because we don't want to hold on to expensive compute resources the job itself requires, while waiting for the editor 
- Editor pinning:
    - Updates editor revisions (`config/_latest_editor_versions_[track].metafile`) on a nightly basis, on the condition that ABV for this editor track passes. This way, if e.g. trunk breaks, it is discovered by the nightly update job (and revisions for this platform won't be updated), and we continue using the latest working revision, until a new working one becomes available.
    - There are 3 types of revisions retrieved from _unity-downloader-cli_: `staging` corresponds to `--fast`, `latest_public` corresponds to `--published-only`, and `latest_internal` corresponds to no flags
    - There are 2 `merge-all` jobs, which are identical except for triggers and dependencies:
        - _[ABV] [CI]_ is the main one used in the CI flow. It is has the branch trigger for versions file, and the dependent merge revision jobs have ABV as dependency (updated revisions only get merged on green ABV)
        - _[no ABV] [no CI]_ is the manual counterpart of CI flow. It has no triggers, and it does not have ABV dependencies, i.e. it is essentially a forced push of updated revisions (since no ABV is run, it merges whatever revisions are on ci branch into target, and regenerates ymls based on those). It is useful for either testing the editor pinning, or to force updating the revisions when ABV dependency is seen as blocking.
    - Setup on master: 
        - 2 nightlies, one for trunk and other for 2020.2 (nightlies contain ABV, package pack/test all, and some additional jobs)
        - ABV on PRs is triggered for 2020.2 (change under `_abv.metafile` `abv.trigger_editors`)
        - Trunk targets latest_internal, 2020.2 targets staging (editor revisions)
        - Package publish all (dependencies) run against trunk (change under `_packages.metafile` `publish_all_track`)
    - Workflow in short:
        - Update job runs nightly on target-branch. It merges target-branch into ci-branch (syncs), gets new revisions for all tracks and pushes these together with updated ymls to ci branch
        - Merge job is triggered on changes to editor version files on ci-branch. It runs a merge job per each track, which (if the ABV with updated revisions passes green) pushes the corresponding editor revisions file to target-branch. Once everything is done, it regenerates all ymls based on whichever revisions have reached master branch.
    - Workflow in details is on figure below
    ![Editor pinning flow](editor_pinning.png)

- Running editor pinning locally:
  - Make sure you have the latest version of unity-downloader-cli
  - Update job: `python .yamato\ruamel\editor_pinning\update_revisions.py --target-branch [localbranch] --local`
    - _--local_ flag specifies that no git pull/push/commit gets executed
    - _--target-branch_ would usually correspond to CI branch, but when running locally, just set it to the one you have checked out locally
    - This job updates `_latest_editor_versions.metafile` locally, and also runs `build.py` again to regenerate all ymls with the updated revisions. You can either keep all of the latest revisions, or only the ones you want, and rerun ymls. Once ready, merge like normal PR (i.e. no need to run the merge_revisions job)
  - Merge job: `python .yamato\ruamel\editor_pinning\merge_revisions.py --target-branch [targetbranch] --local --revision [git sha] --track [editortrack]` 
    - _--local_ flag skips checkout/pull of the target branch (but still makes commit on the currently checkout branch, if there is something to commit)
    - _--target-branch_ the target branch into which the revisions get merged to from the ci branch (after jobs passed on ci branch, when CI context used). But due to the local flag, this branch won't get checked out/pulled.
    - _--revision_ the git SHA of the updated revisions commit (the one made on the ci branch by update job). The job runs `git diff HEAD..[revision] -- [path]`, i.e. diff between the current checked out branch vs that SHA (revision). (The _path_ corresponds to yml files or the latest editor versions metafile, but this is already setup within the job). Therefore the merge job only cares about these two paths, and will not merge other changes. This works, because in general, if merge job gets triggered, then CI branch is 1 commit ahead of target branch (which is the updated revisions commit).
    - _--track_ specifies which editor track the merge job runs for (i.e which editor file it aims to merge)
    - In general there is no need to run this file locally. It is only handy when wanting to test the script for syntax errors/functionality etc.


# FAQ

- How is Nightly ABV set up (all_project_ci_nightly)? Nightly contains the normal ABV (all_project_ci), smoke tests, plus any additional jobs specified in the _abv.metafile under nightly extra dependencies.
- What are smoke tests? Blank Unity projects containing all SRP packages (and default packages) to make sure all packages work with each other
- Why does OpenGLCore not have standalone? Because the GPU is simulated and this job is too resource heavy for these machines
- What happens to editor pinning if ABV is red? If ABV is red, then editor pinning merge job fails, i.e. the target branch (on which ABV runs) will not get editor revisions updated automatically. To remedy this, there are 2 merge jobs, one postfixed with \[ABV\] (triggered automatically, dependent on ABV), other with \[manual\] (triggered manually, not dependent on ABV). If editor revisions must be updated despite the red ABV, then the manual job must be triggered.

### {project_name}.metafile: project jobs configuration
If the project is just a high-level job only consisting of dependencies, then `project.folder`, `test_platforms`, and `platforms` can be left out (i.e. you only need to specify `project.name` and `all.dependencies`).
```
