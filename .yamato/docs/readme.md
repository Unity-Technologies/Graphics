# Purpose
This script generates Yamato job definition files based on configuration/metafiles, making it easier to change the Yamato jobs by (usually) only editing these metafiles.
- Pros:
   - no manual editing means less linter errors, path mismatches etc
   - consistency among all files
   - easy to track changes to .yml files with git diff, since they are in their final form 
   - reduced code duplication and possibility define constants in a single place
- Cons:
   - the higher consistency among files and the reduced code duplication makes introducing exceptions more difficult

# Structure
- *.yamato/config/* - directory containing configurations (metafiles) for the jobs to be generated, this is where most of the changes to Yamato jobs should be introduced (Input)
- *.yamato/*  - directory containing all the generated job definition files (.yml) (Output)
- *.yamato/ruamel/build.py* - main script, which reads the metafiles and dumps the generated ymls into files
- *.yamato/ruamel/jobs/* - directory containing all Python modules for the jobs to be generated, which are organized into subdirectories by domains

# Running the script
Script must be run again each time new changes are introduced in the metafiles.
- Install ruamel by `pip install ruamel.yaml` (or `pip3`)
- Run script inside *ruamel/* directory by `python build.py` (or `python3`)

# Example use cases
The majority of changes are introduced within metafiles (*.yamato/config/\*.metafile*, for details check metafile descriptions below). After introducing changes, the script must be rerun (to clean up current jobs, and fetch the updated metafiles to recreate the jobs)

### ABV related changes (_abv.metafile)
- Add a new project to ABV: add the project name (the one used inside the projectâ€™s own metafile, e.g. Universal) under abv.projects 
- Add a new job to Nightly: add the dependency under nightly.extra_dependencies (these dependencies run in addition to ABV)
- Add job to trunk verification: add the dependency under trunk_verification.dependencies

### Project related changes (project_name.metafile)
- Adding a new job to All_{project_name}: add the new job under all.dependencies (this job can also be from a different project) 
- Adding a new platform/api for the project: extend the list under platforms as indicated
- Creating a new project: create a new metafile same way as is done for existing projects. All ymls get created once the script runs
- Use different platform than what is specified in the shared metafile: override the platform as described in the metafile description under platforms section

### Package related changes (_packages.metafile)
- Adding a new package: extend packages list with new package details. The new package jobs get automatically created once the script runs (pack, publish, test, test_dependencies). The package is also automatically included in test_all and publish_all jobs.


### Changes when branching out
- Make Yamato jobs target a different branch: change in __shared.metafile the target_branch to the one that is needed (e.g.switch master to  9.x.x/release when branching out). This will update ci triggers (for nightly, PRs)
- Change the editors to use on this branch: change  in __shared.metafile the editors section to include the required editors. For instance, when creating a new release branch and editors section must be updated as it is not compatible with master anymore. 

### Other changes to metafiles
- All files follow a similar structure and changes can be done according to the metafile descriptions given below. 

### Changes within Python
- Creating a new job: create a new job file under a domain/, same way as existing jobs are defined. Call this job inside build.py wherever needed. Any new file paths, job ids etc specific to this project should be added to shared/namer.py, and called via this (not hardcoded)
- Changing constants, variables, paths, ids, etc: all changes should be introduced in either shared/namer.py or shared/constants.py
- Extending the YAMLJob building block class: if new functionality is needed, e.g. a new section under any job file is needed, define it as a function under shared/yml_job.py class.
- Changing to using split test/build for Standalone: under jobs/projects/commands/_cmd_mapper.py change the reference to which set of commands to use. For instance, to switch from Linux to Linux split, change under linux section all linux.cmd_* to linux_split.cmd_*. This simply uses the different set of commands, and the project job definition will automatically create split test/build if split commandset is used, and vice versa.

#### Python structure explanation for projects
- Project jobs are defined by 3 job definition files: **standalone** (contains standalone_build job if split commandset is used), **standalone_build** (build job for standalone tests), **not_standalone** (editmode, playmode, playmode_xr)
- Because all jobs follow the same structure no matter which platform/api is used, with only the commands (and the agent) being different, then commands are obtained from files under jobs/projects/commands/{platform}.py by the job definition class. 
    - Each of these files has commands specific to its platform. If commands differ also per api, like for OSX, then {platform}_{api}.py format is used. 
    - Each of these files contains functions for 3 commandsets (for standalone, standalone_build, not_standalone), which are then used according to which job is being created. 
    - The mapping of which commands to use for which platform is done under _cmd_mapper.py. This also makes it easy to switch the set of commands for a specific platform, such as to switch to new split built/test, without completely losing the old solution.

# FAQ

- How is Nightly ABV set up (all_project_ci_nightly)? Nightly contains the normal ABV (all_project_ci), plus any additional jobs specified in the _abv.metafile under nightly extra dependencies.
- What are smoke tests? Blank Unity projects containing all SRP packages (and default packages) to make sure all packages work with each other
- Why does OpenGLCore not have standalone? Because the GPU is simulated and this job is too resource heavy for these machines
