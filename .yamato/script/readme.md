### Yaml-generation

All .ymls in this repository starting with `# This file is generated by ...` are generated by the yaml-generation package. 
To set up yaml-generation locally, follow the steps in https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/ant-yaml-generation.


All other .ymls (without the above-mentioned header) are added manually, support liquid syntax, and don't require the script above.
