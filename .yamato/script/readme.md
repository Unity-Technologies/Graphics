### Yml-generation

All .ymls in this repository starting with `# This file is generated by .yamato/ruamel/build.py. Don't edit this file manually.` are generated by a script in the gfx-sdet-tools repository. Input (`config/*.metafile`) and output (`*.yml`) are still kept in the Graphics repo.
To generate ymls, see instructions written inside `generate_ymls.py`, or contact Graphics SDETs.


All other .ymls (without the above-mentioned header) are added manually, support liquid syntax, and don't require the script above.
