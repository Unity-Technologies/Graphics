# Graphics git hooks

## Installation

This folder contains git hooks for the Graphics repository. 
They can be installed by running `install.sh`.
It will (recursively) create a hard link of each file present in this folder and put it in the `.git/hooks/` folder.

This manual installation step is required because the `.git/` folder can't be pushed to the remote repository and therefore automatically be configured for all developers. 

## Contributing

New types of hooks can be added by creating a script file (e.g. `pre-push`) at the root of this folder.
New hooks' logic should be put in a folder (`pre-push.d/`) and be called by the root file corresponding to the hook type so that the root files stay short and new hooks can be added easily.
