# Graphics git hooks

## Installation

This folder contains git hooks for the Graphics repository. 
They can be installed by running `./unix-install.sh` or `.\windows-install.ps1`, depending on your OS. Running the powershell script on windows requires administrator rights to create the symbolic links.

It will (recursively) create a symbolic link of each file present in this folder and put it in the `.git/hooks/` folder.
This manual installation step is required because the `.git/` folder can't be pushed to the remote repository and therefore automatically be configured for all developers. 

## Contributing

New types of hooks can be added by creating a script file (e.g. `pre-push`) at the root of this folder.
New hooks' logic should be put in a folder (`pre-push.d/`) and be called by the root file corresponding to the hook type so that the root files stay short and new hooks can be added easily.

New scripts should be added to git using [`git add --chmod=+x [file]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt---chmod-x) so that *nix users can use them.
